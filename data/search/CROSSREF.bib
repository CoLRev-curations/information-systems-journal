   abstract                      = {This paper investigates the embeddedness of digital entrepreneurship in the entrepreneurs' indigenous value system by examining the influence of ‘Ubuntu’ on digital entrepreneurship activities in the South African context. We do so through an interpretive field study of two innovation clusters in South Africa. Our findings reveal Ubuntu as the basis of a community orientation to digital entrepreneurship that offers an alternative to the prevalent heroic view in which digital entrepreneurship narratives are centred around the individual entrepreneur(s). They also highlight the tensions faced by digital entrepreneurs as they attempt to uphold the Ubuntu values of humility, reciprocity, and benevolence while operating in a competitive and fast‐paced environment. In addition, our study indicates that the way entrepreneurs draw on their indigenous value system is dynamic, giving rise to what we call digital Ubuntu , reflecting a reworking of Ubuntu values into their increasingly digital reality. The concept of digital Ubuntu brings to light how indigenous values can become entangled with the capabilities of digital technologies and highlights the need for indigenous perspectives to advance our understanding of the diversity of digital phenomena, such as digital entrepreneurship, across cultural contexts.},

A qualitative approach combining the use of log diaries of professional workers and semi‐structured interviews with product development workers provide a preliminary validation of the taxonomy and propositions and allow for the discovery of a continuum of interruption events that fall in‐between the extreme types in the taxonomy. The results show that some IT interruptions have positive effects on individual performance, whilst others have negative effects, or both. The taxonomy developed in the paper allows for a better understanding of the nature of different types of IT interruption and their consequences on individual work.

We show that the distinct logic of EA is added to the institutional context and we find that tensions among existing medical, technical, and managerial logics and EA principles and assumptions emerge. We contribute to the under‐researched topic of EA operationalization by suggesting a model that demonstrates how the meeting of multiple institutional logics can lead to varying degrees of differentiation or even disassociation from EA visions during decision‐taking in projects. Furthermore, we advance extant research on IS projects' implementation in institutionally pluralistic settings by providing an empirical account of actors' interactions and project leadership arrangements that contribute to the persistence of coexisting logics in a dynamic equilibrium.},

This paper describes a novel process understanding of how vicious cycles work and suggests a new method for how they can be reversed into virtuous cycles. Based on the action research and complementary system dynamics simulation, this paper demonstrates how an ineffective ITO relationship between a European Harbour Authority and its main IT supplier ITCo was formed and, later, transformed. The method, involving collaborative redesign of service workflows, applied in this action research triggered the reversal of an otherwise downward relationship spiral. Both the empirical facts from the action research data and the system dynamics simulation data are provided as evidence.

The present study tries to contribute to the literature by proposing and testing a model that examines some of the antecedents and consequences of social integration in system development projects. Data collected from system development project leaders working in 84 US organizations were used to test the model. The findings suggest that higher social integration and, consequently, higher system development project performance is best attained when management provides basic support for the work of the project. The results also reveal that the nature of the relationship between social integration and project performance may be contingent upon some other factors.

   abstract                      = {Abstract. This paper focuses on Cap Gemini’s electronic commerce system, TransLease. TransLease is an interorganizational information system (IOS), which facilitates electronic commerce between motor vehicle leasing and repair companies. During our investigation, the system was used by approximately 1000 repair agents working for seven of the UK’s leading vehicle leasing and contract hire companies. This system was originally developed by AT&T and acquired by Cap Gemini in July 1998. At the time of acquisition, the system was seen as being of high strategic value, although it was also seen as underperforming. This paper reports the results of an action research project, which formed one element of the process by which Cap Gemini investigated the former problem. In the paper, TransLease is described as a complex electronic community, dependent upon the existence of symbiotic relationships. As such, the problems that the system users and developers experienced can be attributed to factors that impeded the mutual benefit accruing from participation in the system. The efficacy of the terms of exchange and the degree to which participants mutually benefit through electronic interaction is determined by the complex interplay of a number of relational and organizational factors. The research therefore illustrates the importance of the ‘soft’ organizational issues in IOS management and development, and suggests a conceptual model of the factors relevant in this case. At the time of this study, TransLease was still in the early stages of its life cycle, having only been available in the marketplace for approximately 18 months. During this time, through recognizing the complex problems and issues detailed in this paper, Cap Gemini accordingly redressed the way in which the system was managed and maintained. TransLease is now seen as having matured into a highly successful example of an IOS – a view reflected by its position as market leader in the industry. As this paper will show, the key to improving the existing service has been the emphasis Cap Gemini now places on managing the ‘soft’ aspects of the electronic community.},

In some ways, the creation and testing of theory seems to be the primary goal of IS research. Despite that, there are persistent questions whether theory has become a fetish in the IS discipline and whether the routinized production and testing of mid‐range theories is little more than an uninspired script that reduces the value and interest of IS research. This paper reframes the discussion around the idea of ‘conceptual artifact’ that has been discussed widely in educational psychology for over a decade. Conceptual artifacts are abstract knowledge objects that can be produced, tested and improved. This paper recognizes the value of both abstract knowledge (conceptual artifacts) and non‐abstract knowledge. It explains that theorizing produces, evaluates or improves useful conceptual artifacts that may or may not be theories. It validates four premises related to conceptual artifacts by showing that theorizing related to work system theory created or used many different types of conceptual artifacts. It identifies nine criteria for evaluating conceptual artifacts and shows that some of them differ from typical criteria for evaluating Gregor Type IV theories. As a whole, it argues that that privileging theory over other types of conceptual artifacts may not be beneficial in pursuing the research questions that the IS discipline needs to study.},

The segmentation procedure, which involved a finite mixture partial least squares estimation, provides more insight into the different ways in which people come to accept new technologies. Unlike other segmentation studies published in IS journals, the resulting segments are based on similarities and differences in the structure of the underlying theoretical models rather than (a collection of) individual variables.

This paper presents a longitudinal study of an Enterprise System (ES) implementation by critically examining the discursive context in which an ES implementation unfolds. The findings show that users strongly supported the ES in the earlier stage of implementation when the technology was an imaginary phenomenon. However, in later stages, when the technology is in use, user support was not consistent. In this phase, the ES produces loss of control and an inability to function as an arbiter of fairness (in allocating resources associated with the system), thereby directly challenging existing professional identities and roles. These outcomes, in turn, generate acts of resistance on the part of workers. Users reach inside the technology and reshape it by devising creative workarounds that produce a sense of reskilling to counter the deskilling produced by the loss of control and power. The analysis also shows that an ES is a complex social phenomenon that is intricately linked to and complicit in shaping organizational structure and identity. In particular, this study shows how technology, structure and identity are in a mutually constitutive relationship.},

   abstract                      = {Organizational downsizing research indicates that downsizing does not always realize its strategic intent and may, in fact, have a detrimental impact on organizational performance. In this paper, we extend the notion that downsizing negatively impacts performance and argue that organizational downsizing can potentially be detrimental to software quality performance. Using social cognitive theory (SCT), we primarily interpret the negative impacts of downsizing on software quality performance by arguing that downsizing results in a realignment of social networks (environmental factors), thereby affecting the self‐efficacy and outcome expectations of a software professional (personal factors), which, in turn, affect software quality performance (outcome of behaviour undertaken). We synthesize relevant literature from the software quality, SCT and downsizing research streams and develop a conceptual model. Two major impacts of downsizing are hypothesized in the conceptual model. First, downsizing destroys formal and informal social networks in organizations, which, in turn, negatively impacts software developers' self‐efficacy and outcome expectations through their antecedents, with consequent negative impacts on software development process efficiency and software product quality, the two major components of software quality performance. Second, downsizing negatively affects antecedents of software development process efficiency, namely top management leadership, management infrastructure sophistication, process management efficacy and stakeholder participation with consequent negative impacts on software quality performance. This theoretically grounded discourse can help demonstrate how organizational downsizing can potentially impact software quality performance through key intervening constructs. We also discuss how downsizing and other intervening constructs can be managed to mitigate the negative impacts of downsizing on software quality performance.},

Enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems are characterized by specific features such as the scope of the ERP modules, interdependent relationships, single database and standard management and processing rules, all of which are capable of causing various degrees of change within the company and, potentially, encourage a more cross‐functional overview of it. This paper develops a theoretical distinction between cross‐functional integration and cross‐functionality as it raises people's awareness of the transverse and coupled nature of work process across different organizational units. It aims to test and discuss the impact of ERP implementation strategy (organizational vision, process re‐engineering, the scope of the ERP modules implemented and speed) on cross‐functionality. The methodology is basically based on a survey of 100 French companies, of which the results are further discussed in five case studies. The results show that all previously mentioned factors play significant roles. These roles should be addressed in future research.},

This study sought to gain a better understanding of these organizational interventions by developing a comprehensive framework based on comparative case studies of 9 organizations. The framework integrates intervention characteristics and barriers IT women experience and the coping methods they use to address barriers.

The findings from this study validate many of Ahuja's propositions and suggest an extended theoretical model that could be used to further explore the challenges women face at various career stages in the IT field.

Evolutionary development has been central to DSS theory and practice for decades, but a significant problem for DSS analysts remains how to conceptualize the improvement of a decision task during evolutionary DSS development. The objective of a DSS project is to improve the decision process and outcome for a manager making an important decision. The DSS analyst needs to have a clear idea of the nature of the target decision task and a clear strategy of how to support the decision process. Existing psychological research was examined for help with the conceptualization problem, and the theory of cognitive bias is proposed as a candidate for this assistance. A taxonomy of 37 cognitive biases that codifies a complex area of psychological research is developed. The core of the project involves the construction of a design artefact – an evolutionary DSS development methodology that uses cognitive bias theory as a focusing construct, especially in its analysis cycles. The methodology is the major contribution of the project. The feasibility and effectiveness of the development methodology are evaluated in a participatory case study of a strategic DSS project where a managing director is supported in a decision about whether to close a division of a company.},

Among these characteristic issues are challenges associated with organisational socialisation and organisational culture. Accordingly, an action design research project was carried out for building a socialisation substitute (an information artefact in the form of a digital organisational culture handbook) to support synthesis of symbolic and pragmatic components of organisational culture at case company Smartly.io, a highly virtual organisation experiencing rapid growth. The paper contributes to the literature on socialisation and organisational culture by demonstrating one approach to designing a surrogate for socialisation that acts as a conduit between the symbolic aspects of organisational culture (such as values) and the pragmatic ones (such as toolkits). The work contributes to organisational discontinuity theory also, via theory‐generating descriptive analysis of the process of building continuity across the organisational culture boundary through creation of an information artefact. The resulting artefact was found to deliver practical utility to the case company and encapsulate generalisable design principles for this building process.},

Much of information technology (IT) implementation research has focused on individuals' acceptance of IT by examining their behaviour when faced with new IT and the antecedents of these behaviours. As they are frequently undertaken within a project framework, IT implementations also entail the application of project management practices in order to be successful. Based on the premise that antecedents of lower level theories are frequently determined by the outcomes of a higher level theory, the present paper illustrates how organizational‐level decisions, examined from the perspective of economics theories, can help explain the antecedents of project risk management at the project and individual levels. To do so, the paper describes an IT implementation effort which went through three phases; the first two of which were abandoned versions of the same project. An organizational‐level analysis of the case from an economics perspective and its project‐level analysis from a risk management perspective show how organizational‐level decisions influenced the antecedents at the project and individual levels, providing a more complete understanding of the IT implementation in question, an understanding which neither a theory approach nor a level perspective could provide on its own.},

Our research examines how the objectives of IT projects and their actual effects in government are influenced by such ideologies and contestations that surround them. We develop our theoretical contribution with a critical discourse analysis that traces the ideological underpinnings of two consecutive IT projects for the administration of international trade in Mexico. This analysis associates the objectives of the IT projects with the emergence and ensuing contestation in Mexican politics of two ideologies: the first ideology concerns free international trade as imperative for economic development; the second ideology concerns public sector modernization that sought to overcome historically formed dysfunctionalities of public administration bureaucracies by adopting management practices from the private sector. The analysis then identifies the effects of the ideologically shaped IT projects on two key values of public administration: efficiency and legality. The insights of this research on the role of ideology in IT innovation complement organizational perspectives of e‐government; socio‐cognitive perspectives that focus on ideas and meaning, such as technology frames and organizing visions; and perspectives that focus on politics in IT innovation.},

   abstract                      = {Drawing from a multidisciplinary literature, we form a theoretical perspective of the social embeddedness of economic activity as interpersonal ties that are formed in relation to the institutions of an economy. From this perspective, we then seek to explain the emergence of networks of micro‐entrepreneurs that conduct their business on the Taobao Web platform in China, and we derive theoretical propositions about the social embeddedness of Web platform‐based economic activity. Two case studies of such networks show how Web platform tools and services create conditions of possibility for developing online business by micro‐entrepreneurs and for overcoming cultural reluctance of economic exchange with strangers. Our research suggests that economic activity on Web platforms is embedded in a mix of virtual and community‐based relations that are shaped by and alter the behavioural norms of a local culture. It also points to the government and the corporate Web platform service provider as important organisational actors enabling the creation of entrepreneurial networks.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. In this paper we reflect on the first 17 years of the Information Systems Journal (ISJ). The reflections are considered under three headings: origin of papers (authors, geographical period, gender and departments), research paradigms (positive/interpretive, qualitative/quantitative, non‐empirical/empirical, espoused theories and research method) and finally, topics. We find that throughout the period, the published papers evidenced a greater internationalization of the journal. On the other hand, some regions and countries are poorly represented. Another imbalance concerns the lack of practitioner papers along with an author‐gender imbalance. Qualitative research exceeds quantitative research by a factor of more than 2:1. Interestingly, papers classified as descriptive/conceptual/theoretical have been largely superseded in the period by those that have some empirical evidence to illustrate the points made. Sometimes it is argued that the discipline of information systems lacks theory and thinking pieces but the ISJ suggests that this is far from the truth. Further, our analysis has revealed around 250 topics discussed using many research methods to explain the phenomena. Depending on the point of view, this may show that the discipline either lacks focus or is exciting and pluralistic. We lean to the latter view, but others have argued for focusing on fewer topics and research methods.},

While the voices of these professional organisations are echoed from positions of power, the concerns of Black IS professors are silenced. In this opinion piece, we centre on the voices of Black professors who seek to thrive in an IS field where they are woefully underrepresented, tokenized, isolated, marginalised and excluded from positions of power. Building on the Black Lives Matter movement's momentum, we offer critical insights about our lived experiences and examine pertinent issues. These issues include systemic racism in the ivory tower and the performative nature of diversity work in the academy. In direct response to the Help the Association of Information Systems (AIS ) Build a System that Provides Equality for All , we offer an inclusive framework for promoting transparency, justification, compliance and enforcement of the AIS's action plan for widening participation in IS.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. Ethical issues, with respect to computer‐based information systems, are important to the individual IS practitioner. These same issues also have an important impact on the moral well‐being of organizations and societies. Considerable discussion has taken place in the Information Systems (IS) literature on specific ethical issues, but there is little published work which relates these issues to mainstream ethical theory. This paper describes a range of ethical theories drawn from philosophy literature and uses these theories to critique aspects of the newly revised ACM Code of Ethics. Some in the IS field on problematic ethical issues which are not resolved by the Code are then identified and discussed. The paper draws some implications and conclusions on the value of ethical theory and codes of practice, and on further work to develop existing ethical themes and to promote new initiatives in the ethical domain},

   abstract                      = {Reflecting on 25 years as editors of the Information Systems Journal ( ISJ ), we analyse some statistics on the ISJ over this period. These include the origins of papers published in terms of author gender, geographical region and academic department, the type of research in terms of positivist or interpretive (and empirical, critical and descriptive, if the latter) and qualitative, quantitative, mixed or descriptive, research method and research category. The paper also consists of personal reflections on the ISJ discussing issues such as motivation for journal editing, impact of research on practice (and vice versa) and loss of control as the journal develops. We also use the ISJ lens to reflect on the discipline of IS as a whole. We hope therefore that this paper might also form part of a collection on the history of the IS discipline.},

   abstract                      = {Existing information systems (IS) research on platform control has largely focused on examining how input control (i.e., the mechanisms used to control platform access) affects complementors' intentions and behaviours after their decision to join a digital platform. Yet, our understanding of how input control is perceived before this decision and how such perceptions influence prospective complementors' intention to join a platform is still nascent. In this regard, our study views input control as a salient signal that shapes prospective complementors' expected benefits and costs (i.e., their performance and effort expectancy), and ultimately their decision to join a digital platform. Drawing on signalling theory and the antecedent‐benefit‐cost (ABC) framework, we conducted a randomized online experiment in the context of donation‐based crowdfunding. The experiment results offer empirical support for this view by showing that input control has distinct and complex signalling effects for prospective complementors. In particular, our findings reveal curvilinear and competing signalling effects, with perceived input control increasing both performance expectancy (at a decreasing rate) and effort expectancy (at an increasing rate). Also, we find that performance expectancy linearly increases prospective complementors' intention to join a platform, whereas effort expectancy linearly decreases their intention to do so. These findings imply that the overall relationship between perceived input control and intention to join follows an inverted U‐shape curve, which means that neither a low nor a high, but a moderate degree of perceived input control maximizes prospective complementors' intention to join. In sum, the results of our study provide novel and important insights into the signalling role that perceived input control plays in shaping prospective complementors' decision to join a digital platform.},

   abstract                      = {As physical products are increasingly augmented with digital technology, manufacturing firms have become part of the development of so‐called smart products and smart services. As such, manufacturing firms are challenged by new market participants and ecosystem partners, particularly from the software development industry, and by the dynamic nature of business relationships. While the academic literature on the distinctive characteristics of ecosystems, particularly digital ecosystems, is rich, the effect of smart service ecosystems' emergence on the foundation of smart products remains uncertain. This study reports on case study research based on 47 semi‐structured interviews with four companies that participate in an industrial smart service ecosystem. Taking an affordance‐theoretic perspective, we uncover the antecedents of and the process of emergent smart service ecosystems. We find that smart service ecosystems have three socio‐technical antecedents: a shared worldview, structural flexibility and integrity, and architecture of participation. We explain the emergence of smart service ecosystems as the result of specialisation in shared affordances and integration of idiosyncratic affordances into collective affordances. We derive seven propositions regarding the emergence of smart services, outline opportunities for further research, and present practical guidelines for manufacturing firms.},

Although researchers attempted to explore the societal or business impact of the sharing economy market, little is known about how individual providers operate their businesses, given that providers are capacity‐constrained , self‐scheduled and unprofessional . In this study, we are interested in the relationship between experience and providers' order selection behaviours. Leveraging a rich and proprietary dataset from a large sharing economy platform—which facilitates the exchanges of home‐cooked meals in China—and employing multiple identification strategies and estimation methods, we find that the number of orders declined by a provider first increases with their experience, but later decreases. However, their sales revenue keeps increasing with experience. Our investigation further reveals that this happens because providers adjust their order selection strategies at different experience levels to achieve higher revenue in the sharing economy. Our study is among the pioneering studies to empirically understand providers' market behaviours in the sharing economy and offers important practical implications.},

   abstract                      = {E‐participation platforms create spaces and opportunities for participation and collaboration between governments and citizens. This paper aims to investigate the role of power on formal e‐participation platforms and digital spaces that are controlled by the governments. Although those types of platforms have been increasing in numerous countries, they have been criticised as often leading to a lack of or decrease in citizen engagement. We propose a relational view that examines how power is related to the use of resources in practice, that is, to resourcing. To explore this issue, we examine citizens' participation on three urban mobility platforms in three major Brazilian cities. Our study makes two main contributions. First, we contribute to the literature on e‐participation by explaining how a relational view of power helps to understand the nature and consequences of citizen participation in public policy‐making. Second, we integrate the concept of resourcing as both a source and constitutive element of relational power. We propose a process‐based model of resourcing as power that opens the black box of resourcing through the identification of three distinct phases in time: resourcing IN , resourcing WITHIN and resourcing OUT .},

   abstract                      = {Information systems (IS) research has been long concerned with improving task‐related performance. The concept of fit is often used to explain how system design can improve performance and overall value. So far, the literature has focused mainly on performance evaluation criteria that are based on measures of task efficiency, accuracy, or productivity. However, nowadays, productivity gain is no longer the single evaluation criterion. In many instances, computer systems are expected to enhance our creativity, reveal opportunities and open new vistas of uncharted frontiers. To address this void, we introduce the concept of generativity in the context of IS design and develop two corresponding design considerations –‘generative capacity’ that refers to one's ability to produce something ingenious or at least new in a particular context, and ‘generative fit’ that refers to the extent to which an IT artefact is conducive to evoking and enhancing that generative capacity. We offer an extended view of the concept of fit and realign the prevailing approaches to human–computer interaction design with current leading‐edge applications and users' expectations. Our findings guide systems designers who aim to enhance creative work, unstructured syntheses, serendipitous discoveries, and any other form of computer‐aided tasks that involve unexplored outcomes or aim to enhance our ability to go boldly where no one has gone before. In this paper, we explore the underpinnings of ‘generative capacity’ and argue that it should be included in the evaluation of task‐related performance. Then, we briefly explore the role of fit in IS research, position ‘generative fit’ in that context, explain its role and impact on performance, and provide key design considerations that enhance generative fit. Finally, we demonstrate our thesis with an illustrative vignette of good generative fit, and conclude with ideas for further research.},

We explore the impact of high sensory enabling (HSE) virtual product presentation modes using state‐of‐the‐art virtual reality (VR) technology that allows consumers to imitate natural movement and interactions via head‐mounted displays (HMD) and dual hand VR controllers. This will compare the HSE virtual product presentation mode with a typical low sensory enabling (LSE) virtual product presentation mode that utilises conventional computer screens, along with mouse and keyboard inputs, on a desktop computer. For the HSE virtual product presentation mode, the results show significantly higher values for the studied variables, including presence, perceived diagnosticity, attitude towards product, and purchase intention. Shopping frequency has a moderating effect on the significant differences of presence between presentation modes. Our research contributes to theory by building on attitude theory, cue summation theory, as well as repetitive learning and memory to explore and explain the effects of HSE virtual product presentation modes on the constructs considered. For managers and industry leaders, this study identifies the importance of using state‐of‐the‐art technology when creating HSE virtual experiences for their products.},

There has been limited research that focuses on how employees' use of information systems in the workplace is associated with their positive and negative dispositions to job and organization. We develop and test a model that posits that dispositions to job (ie, job satisfaction, job security, job anxiety, and emotional exhaustion), and organization (ie, organizational commitment and organizational trust) will play a dual role of antecedents and consequences of system use. We conducted 2 longitudinal studies in the context of 2 different systems—a functional system and an enterprise system—and found support for our hypotheses (N = 257 and 181, respectively). We found that preimplementation job and organizational dispositions significantly predicted both lean and rich measures of system use. Further, we found that rich measures of system use (ie, cognitive absorption use and deep structure use) had differential impacts on postimplementation employee dispositions—functional system use had a positive impact and enterprise system use had a negative impact. Overall, our findings offer a comprehensive understanding of system use, and its antecedents and consequences for employees in organizations.},

For good reasons, central public administrations are conservative by nature. Most public administrations are bureaucracies and bureaucracies tend to resist change. Nevertheless the pressure to obtain better value from public administration information technology investments is growing and the debate as to how to achieve this is increasingly important. Part of this debate is concerned with how best to confront the formidable and specific challenges faced by the sector. These include cultural, structural, resource and technical problems as well as a legacy of isolated developments which do not interrelate. The difficulties are compounded by the problems of evaluation generally in public administration – problems which are reflected in the evaluation of public sector information systems. This drive for change is reviewed and discussed in the context of the Irish civil service, in which there is a growing awareness of the strategic importance of breaking down specialized vertical systems and providing an integrated service to the citizen. A new approach to the problem, based on adapting the concept of business objects, is suggested.},

In this paper, we offer a comparative insight into techniques which characterize different aspects and approaches of workflow specifications. These are: structured process modelling, object‐oriented modelling, behavioural process modelling and business‐oriented modelling. In particular, we determine gaps for workflows capturing operational business transaction processing, for example those of insurance claims, bank loans and government‐related registration. For technique construction, we describe five workflow suitability principles.},

Semantic consensus is a condition where there is pragmatic agreement among database designers and all of the users about which aspect of reality is being represented by a particular database element, and how that representation is being coded. The technique, called semantic database prototyping (SDP), involves a prototype that has been designed and constructed purely as a consequence of the semantic data model. The purpose of the semantic database prototype is to promote direct user validation during the conceptual database design phase of information systems analysis and design. Its distinguishing characteristic is its capture of data element occurrences within the context of the database design. The research method was action research, and the project is also briefly described.},

In recent years, however, a new type of ethnographic research has emerged – one that can be called design ethnography. Design ethnography is where the researcher goes beyond observation and actively engages with people in the field. Our view is that design ethnography has much potential for research in information systems.

An analysis of two studies in the US and Denmark reveals that short cycle time systems development is a new form that can be clearly distinguished among other forms.

These practices include a focus on completion speed, release‐oriented parallel prototyping, adherence to a fixed architecture, negotiable quality, and an ideal workforce. The package is consistent with amethodical development concepts. Systems are not built in a single project that completes with a delivery, but rather are continually ‘growing’ to adapt to an organizational emergence.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. Over the last three decades, a methodological pluralism has developed within information systems (IS) research. Various disciplines and many research communities as well, contribute to this discussion. However, working on the same research topic or studying the same phenomenon does not necessarily ensure mutual understanding. Especially within this multidisciplinary and international context, the epistemological assumptions made by different researchers may vary fundamentally. These assumptions exert a substantial impact on how concepts like validity, reliability, quality and rigour of research are understood. Thus, the extensive publication of epistemological assumptions is, in effect, almost mandatory. Hence, the aim of this paper is to develop an epistemological framework which can be used for systematically analysing the epistemological assumptions in IS research. Rather than attempting to identify and classify IS research paradigms, this research aims at a comprehensive discussion of epistemology within the context of IS. It seeks to contribute to building the basis for identifying similarities as well as differences between distinct IS approaches and methods. In order to demonstrate the epistemological framework, the consensus‐oriented interpretivist approach to conceptual modelling is used as an example.},

Our study found highly cohesive, well‐organised groups that were motivated by scarcity and the lack of high quality music files. Our ethnographic research provides insight into the values and beliefs of music file sharers: their demands are not currently being met. Using Actor‐network theory, we are able to propose that the file sharers represent a growing potential market in the music industry and that music distribution systems should be developed accordingly to meet the demands of this user group. Therefore, this study can serve as a springboard for understanding unauthorised file sharing and perhaps other deviant behaviours using technology.},

The results indicate that while there are fewer instances of communication among group members after the technology is implemented, communication becomes more centralized around the district manager. These results suggest that increased collaborative technologies result in an adjustment between explicit and tacit knowledge sharing, as the availability of a centralized and updateable database reduces workgroup communications. However, consistent with structuration theory, telework group members do use communication technologies to address their most apparent needs and concerns. Other potential explanations and implications of these findings are discussed.},

Through their intrusive features, SHAs threaten to not only increase individual users' strain but also impair social relationships at home. However, while previous research has predominantly focused on technology features' detrimental effects on employee strain at work, there is still a lack of understanding of the adverse effects of digital devices on individuals and their social relations at home. In addition, we know little about how these deleterious effects can be mitigated by using information technology (IT) artefact‐based design features. Drawing on the person‐technology fit model, self‐regulation theory, and the literature on anthropomorphism, we used the synergistic properties of an online experiment (N = 136) and a follow‐up field survey with a representative sample of SHA users (N = 214) to show how and why SHAs' intrusive technology features cause strain and interpersonal conflicts at home. Moreover, we demonstrate how SHAs' anthropomorphic design features can attenuate the harmful effects of intrusive technology features on strain by shaping users' feelings of privacy invasion. More broadly, our study sheds light on the largely underinvestigated psychological and social consequences of the digitization of the individual at home.},

We compare theoretical advancements that emphasize processes and characteristics of openness with the limitations of extant approaches that have largely focused on improvements to productivity and efficiency. Based on Foucault and Bruner's ideas, this paper contributes a new critical narrative approach to understanding openness explicitly focused on structural transformation and power. The analysis focuses on the case of open development, examining 20 key studies based primarily on developing countries. The critical narrative approach unpacked the production of power/knowledge across actors, intentions, and outcomes of openness research and practice. We find that discursive formations are reliant on technocentric and normative ideals of researchers, leading to narratives of hypothetical outcomes that exclude marginalized perspectives. We propose hermeneutic composability and contesting normative narratives of openness as analytical techniques for an integrated, mutually constitutive conception of interactions between individuals, open artefacts, and open social praxis.},

While executive information systems (EIS) constitute a rising trend in the use of information technology in organizations, much is still unknown in terms of the attributes an EIS should possess in order to increase the probability of successful implementation. A survey was conducted on 28 Canadian organizations, with 52 users giving their perceptions on the various attributes of EIS. Results indicate that the more important aspects relate to the quality of information and the benefits provided by EIS. Less important are the user‐interface and technical capabilities. User satisfaction with the attributes of their present system was also measured. In this regard, managers were more content with the quality of information and the user‐interface than with the benefits and the technical capabilities of their EIS. Overall, top‐managers were less satisfied with the present system than lower‐level managers.},

In writings on the open source software development model, it is often argued that it is successful as a result of the gift economy that embraces activities in online communities. However, the theoretical foundations for this argument are seldom discussed and empirically tested. Starting with the ‘classic’ theories of gift giving, we discuss how they need to be developed in order to explain gift‐giving practices in digital domains. In this paper, we argue that the gift economy is important, not only because it creates openness, but also because it organizes relationships between people in a certain way. Open source software development relies on gift giving as a way of getting new ideas and prototypes out into circulation. This also implies that the giver gets power from giving away. This power is used as a way of guaranteeing the quality of the code. We relate this practice to how gifts, in the form of new scientific knowledge, are given to the research community, and how this is done through peer review processes.},

Yet, not all clinical managers are willing and able to support IT innovation, particularly when the institutional logics of an IT innovation challenge their professional practice. We investigate how clinical managers use their hybrid identities to reconcile differences among competing institutional logics that affect IT innovation. Based on three examples of IT innovation (telehealth for obstructive sleep apnoea, telehealth for heart failure, and electrocardiograms) in a health care organization in England, we identify three roles in IT innovation (innovation advocate, innovation broker, and innovation laggard) that clinical managers enacted in response to three degrees of conflict between institutional logics (no conflict, moderate conflict, and high conflict), respectively. We make the following contributions. First, we demonstrate how clinical managers' perception of their hybrid role in relation to their professional identity influences their response to the conflicting institutional demands of IT innovation. We conclude that clinical managers' fragmented identities can compromise their ability to effectively manage IT innovation in health care. Second, our findings raise implications for understanding the role of professionals' hybrid identities in the implementation of digital transformation at the intersection of multiple institutional logics.},

Such communicative patterns are visualised in terms of an innovative artefact known as a pattern comic. The propositional content of communicative acts within such patterns is then expressed as a set of binary relations, which can be transformed into various visualisations of an information model. Patterns of communicative action evident in the domain of medical emergency response are used throughout to illustrate this pragmatic approach to constructing information models.},

We conclude the paper with a consideration of a number of possible revisions to the prescriptions of RAD and also discuss the role of RAD within the broader context of IS development. ‘It’s lots of bits of paper and ticks and post‐it notes and things . . . you’ll get to understand it, it’s not that bad really’.

   abstract                      = {Managing international teams with geographically distributed participants is a complex task. The risk of communication breakdowns increases due to cultural and organizational differences grounded in the geographical distribution of the participants. Such breakdowns indicate general misunderstandings and a lack of shared meaning between participants. In this paper, we address the complexity of building shared meaning. We examine the communication breakdowns that occurred in two globally distributed virtual teams by providing an analytical distinction of the organizational context as the foundation for building shared meaning at three levels. Also we investigate communication breakdowns that can be attributed to differences in lifeworld structures, organizational structures, and work process structures within a virtual team. We find that all communication breakdowns are manifested and experienced by the participants at the work process level; however, resolving breakdowns may require critical reflection at other levels. Where previous research argues that face‐to‐face interaction is an important variable for virtual team performance, our empirical observations reveal that communication breakdowns related to a lack of shared meaning at the lifeworld level often becomes more salient when the participants are co‐located than when geographically distributed. Last, we argue that creating translucence in communication structures is essential for building shared meanings at all three levels.},

To better understand the process through which the relationship between computing devices, users and context changes in everyday life, we apply a distinction between time‐in and time‐out use. Time‐in technology use coincides and co‐exists within the flow of ordinary life, while time‐out use entails ‘taking time out’ of everyday life to accomplish a circumscribed task or engage reflectively in a particular experience. We apply a theoretically informed grounded approach to data collected through a longitudinal field study of smartphone users during a 6‐month period. We analysed the data based on the concept of time‐in/out and show the dynamics in the experience of a device that changes from the ‘extraordinary’ to the ‘ordinary’ over time. We also provide a vocabulary that describes this relationship as stages resembling the one between a couple, which evolves from an early love affair, to being married and to growing old together. By repurposing the time‐in/out distinction from its origin in media studies, this paper marks a move that allows the distinction to be applied to understanding the use and dynamic becoming of computing devices over time.},

Research has found that, when faced with stigma, the most effective and robust strategy for established nondigital firms is to try to and create a distance from it. Open entrepreneurs with different ideologies would likely benefit from similar actions; however, the interdependencies created when they rely upon a digital infrastructure may make this strategy impossible. Given the tensions between ideological heterogeneity and a shared infrastructure, how—and why—do open entrepreneurs respond to stigma? This paper extends existing literature on stigma by developing a model of ideologically mediated responses to stigma by open entrepreneurs through an inductive study based upon interviews, archival, and forum data. We further contribute to extant literature on open entrepreneurship by proposing a model of ideologically mediated responses to stigma, which is grounded in group identity theory. We also build on digital infrastructure literature by proposing the concept of digital infrastructure anchoring . Lastly, we show how ideological heterogeneity leads to business model heterogeneity among open entrepreneurs and discuss the practical implications of this research.},

Yet, to date, the scholarly literature on digital platforms has largely concentrated on business while their developmental implications remain understudied. In part, this is because digital platforms are a challenging research object due to their lack of conceptual definition, their spread across different regions and industries, and their intertwined nature with institutions, actors and digital technologies. The purpose of this article is to contribute to the ongoing debate in information systems and ICT4D research to understand what digital platforms mean for development. To do so, we first define what digital platforms are and differentiate between transaction and innovation platforms, and explain their key characteristics in terms of purpose, research foundations, material properties and business models. We add the socio‐technical context digital platforms operate and the linkages to developmental outcomes. We then conduct an extensive review to explore what current areas, developmental goals, tensions and issues emerge in the literature on platforms and development and identify relevant gaps in our knowledge. We later elaborate on six research questions to advance the studies on digital platforms for development: on indigenous innovation, digital platforms and institutions, on exacerbation of inequalities, on alternative forms of value, on the dark side of platforms and on the applicability of the platform typology for development.},

Drawing from the social entrepreneurship literature and using computational social science methods, we identify the peculiar utilitarian (commercial) and collectivistic (social) identity orientations that shape DSI. We use a sample of 292 DSI initiatives from Latin America and find that DSIs present both utilitarian and collectivist identity orientation. We also find that the collectivistic identity orientation tends to be more salient in less developed contexts. This allows us to discuss implications for the research on DSI and to open up a discussion on the role of context and possible tensions that may emerge in combining both identity orientations.},

This case study demonstrates this complexity through a structurational analysis of a telecare implementation process. The paper shows how structuration concepts enable a combined analysis of actors' interactions with a technology and of the interaction among these actors from different institutional contexts. In this example, fragmented multi‐actor agency induced an inconsistent implementation mode, leading to unsuccessful telecare appropriation. This paper concludes with a preliminary proposal for more consistent telecare implementation modes. These modes may better support the actors' reflexive monitoring and dialogue and inform further research.},

This research goes beyond the simple finding documented in the extant trust literature that the effect of trust will diminish. It sheds light on the role of institutional contexts and develops a nuanced understanding of the boundary conditions under which trust operates in the repurchase stage, where knowledge‐based trust becomes more predominant. Drawing on a different theoretical tenet, prospect theory, we find that customers exhibit distinctively different transaction intentions in the two perceptual conditions of high and low trust in institutional contexts. Specifically, the nonlinear relationship between trust and repeat online transaction intention is inverted U‐shaped curvilinear when trust in institutional contexts is high, but is U‐shaped when trust in institutional contexts is low. With data collected from both e‐commerce and mobile banking contexts using two different measures of institutional contexts, we employed a new and advanced latent moderated structural (LMS) equations approach for analysis and provided robust results. Our findings largely confirm the hypotheses and offer theoretical, methodological, and practical implications.},

Examining four case studies of some of the most successful Fintech platforms in China from the theoretical perspective of the core logics of strategy, we develop a theoretical framework that suggests that the nature of the competitive strategies deployed by a Fintech platform should be contingent on (1) the extent to which their services can be differentiated, as well as (2) the tangibility and physical presence of the platform’s service offerings. More specifically, our framework presents four different combinations of competitive strategies that Fintech platforms can adopt contingent on the nature of their services along these two dimensions. In addition, beyond the two dimensions, our framework suggests that all Fintech platforms should be underpinned by a common strategic core consisting of strategies that align the platform with social pressures. These pressures include those exerted by the government, the market, and society in general. With its findings, it is hoped that our study will provide specific guidance for Fintech practitioners on the appropriate competitive strategies to adopt in order to set their platforms on the path of commercial success.},

This study explores how tendering legislation shapes a buyer's software selection process through the lens of competing decision‐making rationalities. From the literature, 3 rationalities enacted in software selection are deduced that we relate to the software selection literature regarding tendering legislation. Through this lens, we subsequently examine how a large health care provider selected a supplier for an electronic health record system after an extensive tendering process. Many health care professionals within this organization were in favour of a particular software package. Yet, the organization purchased a different package from a relatively unknown supplier, the implementation of which failed. The actors involved experienced shaping on 5 decision‐making themes, the implications of which are evaluated against the functional, economic, and political rationality norms derived from the literature. The findings suggest that compliance with tendering legislation over the public procurement of software results in increased legal complexity, greater linearity and objectivity, more extensive formalization, and less relational communication. Functional norms of rationality are stressed, seemingly to balance the enforced economic norms of rationality and to compensate for the decreased room for political rationality. Even so, the shaping by the tendering legislation threatens functional rationality. Ultimately functional and economic norms of rationality win over political rationality, yet the latter still dribbles through, albeit in a different guise than reported for software selection in general.},

We use partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modelling to analyse survey data from 164 US hospitals at different stages of EA maturity. Our results provide evidence that enterprise architecture maturity directly influences the effectiveness of hospitals' IT resources for achieving strategic goals. Further, enterprise architecture maturity indirectly influences the effectiveness of IT resources when IT alignment is incorporated as a mediating variable.

Practitioners continue to rely upon ‘experimental’ approaches to address the problem. This research attempts to reduce the gap between theory and application, thereby improving conceptual clarity for the transfer of knowledge. The paper, through an in‐depth case analysis conducted within Schlumberger, studies the adoption of an intranet‐based knowledge management (KM) system (called InTouch ) to support, strategically align and transfer knowledge resources. The investigation was undertaken through the adoption of a robust empirically based qualitative research methodology incorporating the role of technology as an enabler of KM application. Consequently, the study addressed the important question of translating theoretical benefits of KM into practical reality. The research formulates a set of theoretical propositions that are seen as key to the development of an effective knowledge‐based infrastructure. The findings identify 30 generic attributes that are essential to the creation, mobilization and diffusion of organizational knowledge. The research makes a significant contribution to identifying a theoretical and empirically based agenda for successful intranet‐based KM, which will be of benefit to both the academic and practitioner communities. The paper also highlights and proposes important areas for further research.},

However, previous efforts have been criticized for their failure to accumulate consistent research findings or develop coherent theoretical frameworks (Markus & Robey, 1988). Part of the problem is that a wide diversity of perspectives is adopted by organizational researchers, and fundamental issues behind these perspectives have yet to be properly examined and resolved (see Burrell & Morgan, 1979); this paper adopts the perspective that some resolution of these issues is possible, or at least should be sought. One approach is to adopt the theoretical framework, built on Giddens' structuration theory (Giddens, 1990), as presented by Orlikowski and Robey (1991), and to use it to analyse a new technology case, that of computer‐aided design/draughting.},

Transaction costs and goodwill trust, which differentiate between transactional and collaborative relationships, were found in existing research to play a significant role in the way organizations use internet technologies to manage their relationships with customers and suppliers within electronic markets (EM). However, a thorough investigation of role that the two dimensions play together in shaping the use of EM is lacking from the mainstream literature. This research addresses transaction costs and goodwill trust together to clarify the transformations that internet use has brought on the nature of interorganizational relationships that develop between EM players. The research finds the use of EM in collaborative relationships is governed by trade‐offs between different outcomes that different EM functionalities have on organizational objectives. Organizations assess these trade‐offs, and select those functionalities that best serve to achieve their collaborative relational objectives. In contrast, no trade‐offs are find in the transactional model, as the use of EM here is driven principally by transaction cost reductions.},

The findings illustrate that: (1) social and organizational problems similar to those that beset ‘traditional’ IS development arise in the development and implementation of web‐based IS; (2) ‘top‐down’ development and implementation strategies give rise to more conflict and change management problems than ‘bottom‐up’ approaches; and (3) fostering high levels of commitment to organizational imperatives is key to the successful development and implementation of web‐based IS.},

The primary difficulty is argued to be the use of information management techniques and concepts to design and develop KM Tools. Also problematic is the existence of a multiplicity of KM technologies, the application and use of which differs across organizations. This paper argues that these problems stem, in part, from the information system field’s over‐reliance on design concepts from the functionalist paradigm. Hence, our contention that alternative perspectives, which bring into focus issues of ontology and epistemology, need to be brought to bear in order to understand the challenges involved in the design and deployment of IT artefacts in knowledge management systems (KMS). The philosophy of technology, with its emphasis on the primacy of praxis, and which incorporates ontological and epistemological concepts from phenomenology and hermeneutics, is applied to the findings of a participative action research study to illustrate how social actors interpret and understand worldly phenomena and subsequently share their knowledge of the life‐world using IT. The outcome of this marriage of situated practical theory and philosophy is a set of design principles to guide the development of a core KM Tool for KMS.},

Based on a multi‐case study with companies from different industries and of varying sizes, we uncover nine core tensions between traditional IT and agile IT as manifestations of five underlying paradoxes. We also identify corresponding management practices to address these tensions and paradoxes. Our study contributes to Information Systems research by disaggregating bi‐modal IT and capturing the tensions and their underlying paradoxes at the organisational and individual levels that bi‐modal IT entails. By highlighting the intricate interdependencies between the traditional and agile IT modes, we show that bi‐modal IT can be messier and more contested than previously anticipated. For practitioners, our study offers an overview of paradoxes and tensions that may arise in bi‐modal IT settings and provides suggestions on how to manage them.},

   abstract                      = {The discontinuance of volitional IS (i.e., information systems adopted, used and discontinued at will) has recently attracted remarkable attention from academics and practitioners alike. However, most research to date has been ahistorical. Ignoring the temporal progression can be problematic when the phenomenon under investigation is dynamic and evolving. To balance this, we adopt a stage modelling approach to understand the process ending with the technology use being discontinued by users of a popular crowdsourcing platform. Two questions guided our investigation: (1) Why do users discontinue using an IS they have volitionally adopted and used? (2) How does IS discontinuance occur over time in such context? We develop a stage model demonstrating that five stages are critical in understanding IS discontinuance: IS framing, goal pursuit, frame disruption, dormancy and quitting, after which possible switching denotes a new cycle. Furthermore, we identify two frames that help us understand why different users interpret and evaluate the technology differently – namely, the gain frame and the hedonic frame. On one hand, a gain frame is linked to the goal of improving one's resources and thus directs the user's attention to the technology's instrumental value. On the other hand, a hedonic frame is linked to the goal of having fun and thus directs the user's attention to the technology's enjoyment value. But, most importantly, we show that the technology's use lifecycle as a whole from initial use to discontinuance is shaped and guided by the user's dominant frame. Our insights elicit a number of important theoretical and practical implications.},

For this study, a research model was developed that includes the factors influencing student nurses' intention to disclose patient health information. The model was empirically tested with nursing students in South Korea with a scenario‐based experiment. We find that both altruistic (impact on others) and egoistic (impact on the self) motivations are significantly important in raising situational empathy. On the other hand, an egoistic motivation (impact on the self) significantly affects people's perception of their responsibility, which mediates the relationship between situational empathy and prosocial intention to disclose.

Integration is a key IS project management issue when new systems are developed and implemented into an increasingly integrated information infrastructure in corporate and governmental organizations. Expanding the perspective of traditional project management research, we draw extensively on central insights from IS research. Building on socio‐technical IS research and software engineering research, we suggest four generic patterns of integration: big bang, stakeholder integration, technical integration and socio‐technical integration. We analyse and describe the advantages and disadvantages of each pattern. The four patterns are ideal types. To explore the forces and challenges in these patterns, three longitudinal case studies were conducted. In particular we investigate the management challenges for each pattern. We find that the patterns are context‐sensitive and describe the different contexts where the patterns are applicable. For IS project management, the four integration patterns are a contribution to the management of integration risks – extending the vocabulary for assessing and mitigating these risks in IS development. For practitioners the four integration patterns represent an analytical framework to be used in planning modern IS development projects.},

In recent years, e‐commerce in China has made significant progress and gone through rounds after rounds of innovations. Technological advancements have enabled the integration of online and offline channels, allowing consumers to choose their preferred shopping channel. Thus, competition and cooperation between online and offline channels have become important issues. Drawing on confirmation bias theory and the unique cultural lens (low uncertainty avoidance and a high level of cynicism) that exists in China, we conceptualize online prejudice and propose a model to analyse how it affects channel selection. A scenario‐based survey, along with an explorative pre‐study, was conducted to test our hypotheses. The results showed that prejudice toward the online channel does exist in China. Further, this online prejudice mediates the relationship between perceived uncertainty and channel selection. That is, uncertainty can induce consumers' online prejudice, which in turn predicts their channel selection behaviour. Furthermore, the mediating effect of online prejudice is contingent upon product type (i.e., experience products vs. search products).},

The former, often referred to as electronic word of mouth (eWOM), is a thoroughly researched topic in the Information Systems literature. Conversely, the digital display of users' behaviours (e.g., number of past purchases) is less well understood despite the widespread adoption of this practice on digital platforms. Quantitative research has explored this interesting domain and found that observing others' behaviours entice observers to follow suit, but has left unaddressed the question of what sensemaking users derive from behavioural information. This is problematic as behavioural information is more open to interpretation compared to eWOM. In this article, we adopt the concept of electronic word of behaviour (eWOB) to denote such behavioural information. Through the lens of basic psychological needs theory and the qualitative means‐end chain approach, we expose how eWOB is interpreted and used by users of a digital platform, the music service Spotify. We find that eWOB leads to satisfaction of the basic psychological needs for relatedness and competence when observing others' behaviours. We also show how exposure to one's own past behaviours can yield a positive sense of self when presented in meaningful and private manners, but that it can also negatively impact users when their needs for autonomy and competence are not heeded by the digital platform. Finally, based on our empirical findings we offer a set of design implications for how digital platforms can optimise the use of eWOB.},

The objectives of the research were to identify factors enabling or inhibiting the adoption and use of information systems and technology (IS/IT) in Portuguese manufacturing small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) and understand how these factors interrelate in determining relative success in the adoption and use of IS/IT. This research elicited factors from previous quantitative and qualitative research, which had been shown to influence IS/IT adoption in SMEs in other contexts. A strategic change framework was used to structure the factors and ensure that comprehensive evidence about their nature and effects could be obtained in the empirical research. Further factors were identified by initial fieldwork, before carrying out 12 in‐depth case studies, across a range of situations – different industries, different levels of adoption and a range of degrees of success in IS/IT use. The pattern that emerged from the analysis of the data shows that certain factor combinations and relationships appear to determine the relative degrees of IS/IT success across the firms. This pattern can also be explained by interpreting the roles and relationships of the key actors involved in the process of IS/IT adoption and use. Top management perspectives and attitudes towards IS/IT adoption and use play an important role in the development of internal IS/IT competencies and provide an important contribution to the development of a context that enables IS/IT success.},

In the analysis presented here, conflict becomes more than just dysfunctional communication and provides an alternative set of unifying principles and rationales for understanding social interaction and identity shape shifting within an online community. A model is advanced that describes the systematic techniques of hostility and aggression in technologically enabled communities that take the form of contemporary tribalism. It is argued that this tribe‐like conflict embodies important rituals essential for maintaining and defining the contradictory social roles sometimes found in online environments. This research offers a critical interpretive perspective that focuses on the link between identity shape shifting behaviours and the power relations within an online financial community. The analysis reveals how conflict between positions of power can help to align the values and ideals of an online community.

Findings from our ethnographic enquiry at a large corporate healthcare organisation in India link doctors' historically rooted social standing to the symbolic recognition of their embodied emotional capital existing in tandem with their habitus. The symbolic recognition of emotional capital provided a better valorisation of clinical capital and allowed the accumulation of other forms of capital—institutionalised capital, social capital and economic capital—that formed doctors' capital structure and contributed to their social status. Doctors produced emotional capital by putting their habitus into practice and, in the process, reproduced its symbolic status and their social status linked to it. HIT challenged doctors to put their habitus into practice, thereby creating a perception of threat to emotional capital. Doctors' HIT resistance was a conservation strategy to reproduce their historically rooted higher social status. Findings from this study contribute to the literature on Power and IT resistance.},

The DITIM suggests that radical changes in computing platforms result in pervasive and radical innovations in software development organizations across three innovation types: base technologies adopted, services produced and processes adopted. Upstream attributes (amount and radicalness) of the base innovations impact effects in‐kind downstream (a.k.a., strong order effects) on services and processes. Extending these tenets of the DITIM, we posit that during disruptive information technology (IT) innovation, the temporal stage of innovation activity (early vs. late) by software development organizations will significantly impact four innovation characteristics: (1) adoption rate of radical IT innovations, (2) strong order effects on downstream innovations related to the amount of innovation, (3) perceived radicalness of innovations and (4) strong order effects on downstream innovations related to the amount of perceived radicalness of innovation. We examine these impacts by reanalysing a cross‐sectional study of 121 software development organizations that adopted internet computing as reported in the original data analysis of the DITIM. By splitting the data into early and late adopter groups, our moderation analysis shows significant differences between early and late adopting groups in each of the four hypothesized impacts. Specifically, the adoption rate of radical IT innovations, strong order effects on the amount of innovation, perceived radicalness of innovations and strong order effects on perceived radicalness were each found to differ between early and late adopters. However, it is also important to consider innovation type as three significant effects were in the opposite direction for process innovations. These findings suggest that IT‐innovation scholars and practitioners should carefully consider innovation timing and type when studying or managing radical IT innovation.},

In order to develop ‘citizen‐centred’ e‐government services that provide participants with accessible, relevant information and quality services that are more expedient than traditional ‘brick and mortar’ transactions, government agencies must first understand the factors that influence citizen adoption of this innovation. This study integrates constructs from the Technology Acceptance Model, Diffusions of Innovation theory and web trust models to form a parsimonious yet comprehensive model of factors that influence citizen adoption of e‐government initiatives. The study was conducted by surveying a broad diversity of citizens at a community event. The findings indicate that perceived ease of use, compatibility and trustworthiness are significant predictors of citizens’ intention to use an e‐government service.

In presenting this alternative path, this study unveils a five‐phase change process that both altered perceptions of the technology and its possibilities at the same time resolving tensions among the drivers and users of the mandated system. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

This study examines the extent to which software diffusion and infusion affect the decision to replace ‘off‐the‐shelf’ software, using the example of spreadsheet software. Transaction cost economics motivates the propositions that higher levels of software diffusion and higher levels of software infusion act as disincentives on the firm’s decision to upgrade or change off‐the‐shelf software. Our focus on software diffusion and infusion extends previous research that only examined hardware infusion and diffusion. Results from the study, using a survey, newsgroups and interviews, generally support the propositions and show that the more software is diffused and infused into a firm, the less likely it is to be changed or upgraded. More specifically, the results also show that, while software infusion acts directly to reduce the likelihood of software replacement, software diffusion only affects it indirectly through its effect on infusion.},

The current paper provides an overview of the various uses of case study research in the information systems field by describing the different ways in which case study research can be used, using examples from published IS literature for illustration, and providing references to other method papers for more detailed discussion of each alternative. Researchers are reminded that case study research can be used in the positivist and interpretivist traditions, for testing or building theory, with a single or multiple case study design, using qualitative or mixed methods.

We focus on explaining the persistence of paper use at Ghana customs despite more than a decade of digitalization and automation to establish paperless processes that eliminate malpractices of traditional clearance. We view modernization as a process of long‐term institutional change and therefore draw from the literature on IT and institutional change to focus our investigation on the dynamics of incongruent institutional logics of IT and public administration. We show that in the administration context of a developing country like Ghana, the endurance of patrimonial logics in the state and broader society, coupled with high levels of administrative discretion and ambivalent or weak compliance pressure limit the realization of IT for modernization and allows hybrid practices to emerge.},

We selected MedicineAfrica – a digital platform known for creating social value by providing medical education in regions with under‐resourced healthcare systems – and drew on multiple data collection methods. We found that it is through a unique form of digital health activism that social value is created in this context. Drawing on a sociological understanding of digital health activism, we make the following contributions: First, we identify three types of non‐economic, social value: cognitive, professional and epistemic. Second, we indicate that social value creation is enabled by three emergent forms of digital health activism (ie, philanthropic, moral and reciprocal activity). Third, we elicit three enabling mechanisms explaining how these forms of activism are technically and socially afforded through the platform's connective capacity and emerging collective practices in tandem with its members' growing commitment. Our article contributes to the growing IS literature on digital activism by offering a framework that elucidates how digital health activism relates to social value creation. The article provides practical implications as to how platforms can enable sustainable online (health) communities.},

The study attempts to answer the research question of how SMEs achieve agility to respond to DDI. Drawing on a case study of an innovative SME, our study develops a framework on agility based on the processes of mitigating organizational rigidity, developing innovative capabilities, and balancing the tension of organizational ambidexterity. Specifically, our findings show that for SMEs, mitigating organizational rigidity is enabled by the mechanism of achieving boundary openness while developing innovative capability is enabled by the mechanism of achieving organizational adaptability. At the same time, given the inherent challenges of resource constraints, SMEs also need to balance the tension of organizational ambidexterity.},

IT managements overall importance assessments of business functions were more strongly correlated with their overall level of implementation, and they tended to rate system benefits and system reliability more highly.

We provide answers to the following research questions: (1) For whom does the DIY approach work in the context of assistive technology? (2) Under which circumstances do DIY work? and (3) How can researchers make DIY a satisfying experience? The evidence we collected during the “iCare” project suggests that DIY attracts both, elderly people with a need‐based motive and a hedonic motive. It also shows that a participatory approach and an early engagement with potential users, their family members, and informal caregivers is beneficial for improving design and use‐related aspects of the AT and the DIY intervention.},

Following the migration theory, this study empirically examines the three categories of antecedents for SNS switching intention: push (i.e., dissatisfaction and regret), pull (i.e., alternative attractiveness), and mooring (i.e., switching costs) factors. The results show that the three categories of factors had varying degrees of effects on switching intention. Additionally, the strong moderation effects of both pull and mooring factors help answer the question why switching does not necessarily occur when push factors are in effect.

Systems development issues occupy a position of central importance in the information systems field and much has been prescribed in the quest for successful systems development. However, given the well‐documented ‘software crisis’, success is far from guaranteed for systems development projects. Many researchers see the solution to the software crisis in terms of increased control and the more widespread adoption of rigorous and formalized system development methodologies. This paper presents some arguments and pressures which support the use of methodologies and some evidence of the literature bias which favours methodologies is provided. However the problems associated with the use of methodologies have not perhaps received as much attention in previous research. This paper identifies a number of arguments and pressures which question the value of methodologies, and reports the results of a field study which investigated the role of methodologies in practice. The critical perspective adopted throughout shows that, contrary to the predominant view in literature, the assumption that increased adoption of methodologies addresses the problems inherent in systems development is by no means proven.},

   abstract                      = {A common assumption in prior research on social networking sites (SNS) has been that users' orientations toward SNS use are positioned somewhere along a bipolar, univalent continuum, stretching from negative to positive orientation. However, considering recent findings unfolding the intricacy and variety of SNS use patterns, such a linear conceptualization of users' orientations is too simplistic with limited ability to explain the intricate patterns of SNS use. To alleviate this deficiency in this paper, we draw on the ambivalence literature and explain that users can simultaneously experience both positive and negative orientations toward SNS use based on the positive and negative aspects of their SNS use experience. Focusing on post‐ adoptive SNS use context, we theorise archetypes of SNS users' attitudinal responses to ambivalence, and their associated behavioural outcomes in terms of SNS use patterns. We first follow a typological perspective and develop typologies of attitudinal and behavioural responses to ambivalence toward SNS use. Then, we offer six hypotheses that explain the relations between the archetypes of attitudinal responses to ambivalence toward SNS use and users' SNS use patterns. Lastly, we empirically test our hypotheses using latent profile analysis and ANCOVA applied to two‐wave data collected from 370 ambivalent SNS users. The findings support the hypotheses and validate our typologies. The findings ultimately point to likely choices from a range of post‐adoption SNS use patterns as plausible outcomes of SNS users' attitudinal responses to ambivalence.},

As entrant platform providers seek to cultivate an ecosystem, they must carefully navigate these power relationships when dealing with governance tensions. Providers generally seek to leverage the ecosystem's generative potential by facilitating a variety of interactions and distributing design rights. Simultaneously, they need to ensure stability and order by imposing rules that resolve contentious matters and restrict ecosystem participants' degrees of freedom. This study explores how and why providers can induce ecosystem actors to engage in collaborative negotiation regarding such governance tensions through a case study of the introduction of an open data platform in the Swedish public transport sector. Our analysis offers three main contributions. First, it provides an empirical demonstration that entrepreneurial threats, as well as opportunities, can trigger platform launches and drive collaborative negotiation of digital ecosystem governance. Second, it extends conceptualizations of boundary resources beyond the current focus on transactional elements by demonstrating the role of interactive boundary resources in the negotiation of governance grounded in both social and systemic power relationships. Third, it shows how positive reinforcement can complement punitive measures to increase acceptance of design rules.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. Because of the influence of globalization and updated information technologies (IT), firms in China face an urgent need to adopt e‐procurement systems (EP) to deal with their daily procurement activities. However, implementing EP in China encounters various uncertainties from internal and external business environments. To address this issue, this research aims to examine the fit between business and the IT environment and to study its impact on system performance. The literature review allows the proposal of two internal business environmental uncertainties and two external business environmental uncertainties covering the perspectives of process, knowledge, partnership and environment. Based on a multiple‐case study performed in four Chinese firms that supply various personal computer components to a Taiwanese original equipment manufacturer via an EP, it was found that the firms’ external and internal uncertainty factors affected the performance of EP. In addition, an EP with a low level of integration – the EP type used most frequently in China – can only achieve great performance when the adopting firms faced a low uncertainty of environment, partnership and process, and had low levels of IT knowledge. It was also observed that lack of fit between the business environment and EP produced extra burdens and costs in the buyer–supplier relationship. This significantly reduced the system performance of the Chinese firms. Hence, the contribution of this research can be twofold. First, practitioners in China can use this framework to diagnose their environmental conditions and then choose the appropriate type of EP to implement. Second, researchers can build upon this model to further examine the impact of fit on EP performance and generalize the results.},

However, little research describes how this is actually carried out. The objective of this research was to answer the core question: how do organizations identify the expected benefits of proposed IS projects? To accomplish this objective, the authors studied 24 projects by interviewing 20 subjects from 13 organizations. Based on these interviews, a model of the benefit identification process was formulated showing it to be a set of loosely defined, overlapping, iterative activities. The study suggests that, despite great uncertainty about the potential benefits, proposers were compelled to use the benefit identification process to persuade the organization to be committed to the project. This effort to build commitment under great uncertainty may contribute to the overstatement or understatement of expected benefits. The study offers managers an understanding of the process and guidance for carrying it out. It also suggests that future researchers validate the model, use it to help identify best practices and test related hypotheses.},

We investigate and analyse the semantic alignment process by which stakeholders achieve shared understanding in requirements development.

Several initiatives to address these complex, global problems have resulted in fragmented solutions. Recognizing this, there have been several calls for the study of responsible innovation (RI) to address grand challenges. Digital platforms such as AirBnB, Uber and so forth have now become commonplace and are known to generate economic value but also face criticism for being exploitative and exclusive. Only a handful of studies show how similar platforms can innovate responsibly to serve marginalized communities by generating simultaneous economic and social value. To address this gap, our study examines the cases of two platforms that orchestrated ecosystems consisting of individuals from marginalized communities, government agencies, and other entities to provide physical, digital and societal solutions based on principles of RI. We contribute to the RI and IS literatures to show how RI solutions can be fostered through digital platforms to address grand challenges. The article provides empirical evidence of all four dimensions of the RI framework—anticipation, reflexivity, inclusion, and responsiveness ‐ and their operationalization through digital platforms. This research lays the foundation for future studies at the intersection of RI and digital platforms literature. The study also provides practice insights on developing digital platform solutions for marginalized communities to address grand challenges and is useful to policymakers to formulate appropriate interventions. It pushes the theoretical and practice boundaries of our understanding of RI and digital platforms.},

To examine this relationship, we leverage a fundamental construct: harmonious IT affordance (HITA). HITA is defined as the degree of coalignment between three salient organisational IT affordances, each of which allows an organisation to carry out its most fundamental functions using IT—collaboration, maintenance of organisational memory, and management of organisational processes. We theorize that HITA has a quadratic (U‐shaped) effect on innovation. Our theory proposes that when IT affordances increasingly co‐align (reflected by increasing HITA), the organisation enters a synergistic, virtuous phase that encourages innovation. Counterintuitively, the increasing misalignment of IT affordances can also result in organisational innovation via creative dissonance, which enables organisations to look for opportunities in the presence of misalignment and leverage it to create a synergistic virtuous cycle. We conducted two empirical studies—one with high‐level IT executives knowledgeable about innovation and one with sales and business development executives (who market innovations) knowledgeable about IT—that corroborate our theory. Crucially, if the IT affordances are unrelated (low coalignment, where HITA is close to zero), then innovation does not take place. We thus surmise that the relation between HITA and innovation is quadratic.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. The field of information systems (IS) has evolved for more than three decades. Although many schools of thought have emerged and even become well established, few historical analyses of research paradigms and methodologies have been undertaken. One of the rare exceptions is Orlikowski & Baroudi (1991). Yet, the IS research community has evolved substantially since 1991 in many aspects. A variety of journal outlets have emerged and become well established. More attention has been paid to paradigmatic and methodological issues. Political and professional contexts have also changed noticeably. Therefore, it should be an opportune time for the field to ask: ‘What changes are manifested in journal publications?’‘Is the field making progress regarding pluralism in IS research?’‘How will the field's publications practices change in the future?’ The purpose of this paper is to investigate these questions and, in turn, reflect on the paradigmatic and methodological progress made since 1991. We examined 1893 articles published in eight major IS publication outlets between 1991 and 2001. Our findings suggest that the long‐term endeavours of interpretivist researchers might need to continue because the paradigmatic progress appears somewhat inconsequential; positivist research still dominates 81% of published empirical research. In particular, US journals, as opposed to European journals, tend to be more positivist, quantitative, cross‐sectional and survey oriented. With respect to research design, survey research is still the most widely used method (41%), although case studies have gained substantial recognition (36%). Further, the increase of qualitative research (30%), empirical studies (61%) and longitudinal cases (33%) at the expense of laboratory experiments (18%) might suggest that IS researchers have become more interested in obtaining scientific knowledge in real world settings. In summary, we suggest that the field has been dominated by the positivist paradigm, despite calls to the contrary. Indeed, if the field was to truly embrace pluralism, it would have to find ways to fundamentally change the publication practices of the journal system, including the current tenure and promotion system, which pose considerable obstacles for the acceptance of alternative paradigms.},

Meanwhile, the concept of “adaptive behaviour” of frontline employees has received little attention in the literature related to CRM systems in which the frontline employees are the primary users. In this study, we propose that with the aid of CRM systems, individual employees are able to immediately access information about customers and service offerings, thus enabling their adaptive behaviours to provide personalized service to individual customers. Based on coping theory, we develop a CRM system‐driven adaptive behaviour model that explains how CRM systems facilitate individual employees' service performance by enabling adaptive behaviour during their service encounters. Multisourced data from a financial company in China largely support our proposed model, showing that employees' postadoption of CRM systems ( routinization and infusion of use ) enables interpersonal and offering adaptive behaviours , which in turn enhance employees' service performance. In addition, forming a postadoption behaviour of CRM systems relies on the frequent use. We discuss the theoretical and practical implications of adaptive behaviour in service encounters with the aid of CRM systems.},

The research model is tested with a scenario‐based survey method. Players' perceived threat refers to the negative consequences (eg, reduced performance or social isolation) that are caused by problematic smartphone game use. The findings indicate that under high fear appeals, threat appraisal creates fearful emotions about suffering from the negative consequences, which further reduces the gaming habit and activates the intention to decrease use. Self‐efficacy in decreasing game playing, the response efficacy of decreasing usage in avoiding the threat and subjective norms effectively promote users' intention to decrease use. Moreover, response costs reduce the intention to decrease use. The findings provide insights into how to activate users' intention to decrease problematic use, and the resulting implications are discussed.},

Our review suggests that AR lends itself strongly towards pluralist approaches which facilitate the production of both theoretical and practical knowledge. First, on the level of each study we analyse how research and problem‐solving activities are mixed, in three ways: the research dominant, the problem‐solving dominant and the interactive approaches. Second, in the context of the wider research programme in which the study is situated, we analyse how AR is mixed with other research methods, in two ways: the dominant and the sequential approaches. We argue that these pluralist practices of mixing types of research activities and types of research methods provide IS action researchers with a rich portfolio of approaches to knowledge production. This portfolio helps them address the risks involved in AR to ensure their efforts contribute to the literature as well as to practical problem‐solving.},

As with any other information system (IS), the success of Web‐based learning depends largely on user satisfaction and other factors that eventually increase users’ intentions to continue using the service (continuance intention). This research integrates the IS success model and fairness theory to construct a model for investigating the motivations behind learners’ intentions to continue using Web‐based learning. Our model theorizes that the three dimensions of quality (i.e. information, system and service) and the three dimensions of fairness (i.e. distributive, procedural and interactional) affect learners’ satisfaction. We also argue that satisfaction and the three dimensions of fairness will influence learners’ intention to continue using Web‐based learning. The hypothesized model is validated empirically using data collected from 289 learners of a Web‐based learning service. The results show that information quality, system quality, system use, distributive fairness and interactional fairness exhibit significant positive effects on satisfaction. Also, procedural fairness and satisfaction play significant roles in shaping learners’ intention to continue using Web‐based learning.},

By focusing on online stores, this study investigates the repeat purchase intention of experienced online buyers based on means‐end chain theory and prospect theory. In the research model, both utilitarian value and hedonic value are hypothesised to affect repeat purchase intention positively. Perceived risk is hypothesised to affect repeat purchase intention negatively and moderate the effects of utilitarian and hedonic values on repeat purchase intention. Utilitarian value is proposed as a formative second‐order construct formed by product offerings, product information, monetary savings and convenience. Hedonic value is also proposed as a formative second‐order construct formed by the six hedonic benefits that have been identified in prior research. Data collected from 782 Yahoo!Kimo customers provide strong support for the research model. The results indicate that both the utilitarian value and hedonic value are positively associated with buyers' repeat purchase intention. A higher level of perceived risk reduces the effect of utilitarian value and increases the effect of hedonic value on repeat purchase intention. Implications for theory and practice and suggestions for future research are provided.},

Conflicting definitions of virtuality make it hard to measure such things as how much virtual teaming occurs and how virtual teaming affects performance. As a consequence, it is hard to allocate funding and to design infrastructures and software to support this specific mode of working. Using the concept of discontinuities, or changes in expected conditions, we propose a virtuality index to assess how ‘virtual’ a given setting is. The discontinuities used include geography, time zone, organization, national culture, work practices, and technology. The index separately measures these aspects of virtuality and their effect on perceived team performance. Data collected at a large multinational corporation clustered into three overarching discontinuities: team distribution, workplace mobility, and variety of work practices. The study revealed that being distributed in and of itself had no impact on self‐assessed team performance. Work practice predictability and sociability mitigated effects of working in discontinuous environments, while variety of practices (cultural and work process diversity) and employee mobility negatively impacted performance.},

Entrance is not a trivial event; rather, it is a rite of passage into a complex practice world and marks a critical field moment. Drawing on our ethnography and insights from hermeneutics and anthropology, we show that a practical understanding of the field represents a fusion of horizons where a fieldworker is thrown. The concept of thrownness highlights the fact that the fieldworkers' own historicity and prejudices affect their entrance into the field; hence, entrance into the field orientates an ethnographer in the field and influences the entire period of fieldwork that follows.

Based on existing literature on factors influencing girls' career choices and on an empirical qualitative study in three schools in Australia, a conceptualisation of the influence of middle‐school experiences on girls' ICT study and career choices is presented. This conceptualisation is used as a guide to evaluate a recent intervention programme aimed at promoting ICT study and work opportunities to middle‐school girls. A number of recommendations for future programmes are provided, highlighting the need to study how subcultures that support ICT career choices develop and are supported in Australian schools.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. Methodologies for understanding business processes and their information systems (IS) are often criticized, either for being too imprecise and philosophical (a criticism often levied at softer methodologies) or too hierarchical and mechanistic (levied at harder methodologies). The process‐oriented holonic modelling methodology combines aspects of softer and harder approaches to aid modellers in designing business processes and associated IS. The methodology uses holistic thinking and a construct known as the holon to build process descriptions into a set of models known as a holarchy. This paper describes the methodology through an action research case study based in a large design and manufacturing organization. The scientific contribution is a methodology for analysing business processes in environments that are characterized by high complexity, low volume and high variety where there are minimal repeated learning opportunities, such as large IS development projects. The practical deliverables from the project gave IS and business process improvements for the case study company.},

Compared to western countries, live streaming in China highlights the lively social atmosphere and heated social interactions among streamers and viewers. This study develops a cultural context‐sensitive model that contextualises the purchase of virtual gifts in live streaming in China. Specifically, we focus on the viewer's social experience and the social atmosphere in live streaming which have received limited attention yet. We introduce viewers' social perceptions with regard to the streamer and other viewers (ie, perceived proximity to the streamer and sense of belonging to the viewer crowd) and show how such social perceptions contribute to the development of flow experience, which subsequently leads to purchase intention. This study also reveals how such social perceptions can be shaped by the contextual setting consisting of the IT‐related factors of live streaming (ie, responsiveness, two‐way communication, social presence, and self‐presentation) and the cultural characteristics of China (ie, social orientation and harmony). Our research offers both theoretical guidance for practitioners into cultivating viewers' purchase of virtual gifts in China's live streaming.},

The research reported here sought to answer the questions: are these social issues empirically verifiable constructs? Second, what consensus exists on the factors? A field survey of 79 business professionals and students identified 12 factors which were grouped into five clusters: ownership, access, motivation, responsibility and privacy. These constructs identify additional dimensions and complexity to extend Mason's definition of key ethical issues. The importance of separating the computer user who experiences the ethical dilemma from the stakeholder(s) who deal with the consequences of the dilemma is identified. This study also demonstrates some consensus within the survey items. Consensus exists that it is unethical to profit from non‐job, computer‐related acts. Consensus also exists that personal use of company‐owned information technology resources is acceptable. The other items show little consensus, identifying areas of necessary discussion within the computing professions to determine ethically consistent and appropriate computer uses.},

We commenced with a literature review and exploratory interviews to define the IS‐environmental absorptive capacity construct. We then developed a model that proposes that sustainable IS triggers, knowledge exposure and prior experience influence IS‐environmental absorptive capacity, which in turn contributes to the level of environmentally sustainable IS assimilation as well as to the cost saving, operational performance and reputation of organisations. The model was first tested through an international survey of 148 senior IS managers. The findings support our model regarding the antecedents and value of IS‐environmental absorptive capacity. A follow‐up case study corroborated the survey results and provided additional insights into the nature and causes of IS‐environmental absorptive capacity and its value. This study, in addition to presenting empirical evidence, defines and operationalises the IS‐environmental absorptive capacity construct in a theoretically and operationally meaningful way.},

Beyond SDG 11 concerning the development of sustainable cities, many of the SDGs target activities falling within the responsibility of local governments. Thus, cities will play a leading role in the achievement of these goals, and we argue that the information systems (IS) community must be an active partner in these efforts. This paper aims to contribute to the achievement of the SDGs by developing a conceptual model to explain the role of IS in building smart sustainable cities and providing a framework of action for IS researchers and city managers. To this end, we conduct grounded theory studies of two green IS used by an internationally recognized smart city to manage water quality and green space. Based on these findings, we articulate a model explaining how an integrated information ecosystem enables the interactions between three interrelated spheres – administrative, political and sustainability – to support the development of smart sustainable cities. Moving from theory to practice, we use two real‐world scenarios to demonstrate the applicability of the model. Finally, we define an action framework outlining key actions for cities and suggest corresponding questions for future research. Beyond a simple call‐to‐action, this work provides a much‐needed foundation for future research and practice leading to a sustainable future for all.},

It draws on the ideas of critical systems thinking (CST), a research perspective that encourages the analysis of stakeholders’ understandings prior to the selection and implementation of planning methods. The framework emphasizes continuous identification of concerns from stakeholders, and facilitates critical reflection in the exploration of possibilities for improvement. Some of these possibilities might require the support of IS and communication technologies. To define the framework, two systems theories are used: boundary critique and autopoiesis. The first one enables critical reflection on values and assumptions about potential situations or marginalization. The second one fosters continuous dialogue, listening and mutual collaboration between participants. With these theories, the framework enables people to reflect on issues of inclusion, exclusion and marginalization, and to participate in the design of plans for improvement. Ultimately, the definition of this framework suggests the importance of critical reflection about ethics to improve the practice of IS planning.},

This paper describes a qualitative case study that examined the day‐to‐day practices of two highly dispersed virtual teams, with the initial conceptual lens informed by Carlile's (2004) knowledge management framework. Our observations suggest that knowledge coordination in these highly dispersed virtual teams involves the continuous production and reproduction of digital artefacts (which we refer to as technology practices) through three paired modes: ‘presenting‐accessing’ (related to knowledge transfer); ‘representing‐adding’ (related to knowledge translation); and ‘moulding‐challenging’ (related to knowledge transformation). We also observed an unexpected fourth pair of technology practices, ‘withholding‐ignoring,’ that had the effect of delaying certain knowledge coordination processes. Our findings contribute to both the knowledge coordination literature and the practical use of digital artefacts in virtual teams. Future research directions are discussed.},

It has been suggested that the problem with much of the research on gender and computing is that it is under‐theorised . The contribution of this study is an evaluation framework , designed to evaluate gender and computing interventions , which will advance the theorisation of research through programme evaluation . This study was undertaken in three phases : The first involved theory building through an extensive review of the literature resulting in a conceptual framework for intervention programme evaluation . The second phase consisted of a multiple‐case study of 14 major intervention programmes in Australia . Subsequent modifications to the conceptual framework resulted in the gender and computing intervention evaluation framework . The value of the framework was confirmed in phase three by intervention experts and showed that applying the framework will help programme champions to evaluate their programmes more thoroughly . The dissemination of sound evaluation results will then enable a deeper theorisation of the issues surrounding gender and computing interventions .},

Drawing from prior research on organisational control, we conduct qualitative case studies at four organisations to examine the extent that traditional and contemporary systems development approaches can highlight a unique combination of control attributes. Based on the data collected, we build an ISD control typology that differentiates ISD approaches on the basis of control objectives (product or process focused) and control practices (preventive or detective/corrective focused). The proposed typology can be used by practitioners to inform and guide more effective systems development control choices while providing researchers with a new model that recognises the unique control aspects of today's systems development approaches.},

   abstract                      = {Controls are widely regarded as a key factor in driving high performing organisational processes. However, because of ongoing changes within information systems (IS) processes, control modifications are commonly required in order to maintain performance levels. Although past research recognises the ongoing benefits derived from successful control changes, there is a limited understanding of the actual steps taken by organisations, particularly with regard to avoiding negative performance implications such as process delays or employee resistance. This research draws on empirical data from six case studies to propose a new process model that depicts the interconnected steps involved in control changes. Our findings suggest that the sources of IS control change may be more diverse than most past research suggests and that control changes within non‐project‐oriented processes (e.g. enterprise architecture) present additional challenges in comparison to project‐oriented processes (e.g. systems development). Insights from this research can aid practitioners in streamlining control changes as a means to improve effectiveness, whilst also contributing to research by uncovering an enhanced understanding of why and how control changes are made in IS processes.},

This research delves into the security fatigue concept, investigates its antecedents and reports how fatigue affects employee security policy compliance (and non‐compliance). Since security fatigue is not well articulated in the literature and there is limited understanding of its antecedents and consequences, we take a research approach that affords novel insight into this phenomenon. Specifically, we conduct 38 in‐depth interviews with business and IT professionals, and then use a qualitative approach to construct a model, including seven research propositions, to highlight the key aspects of security fatigue. Our results indicate that four distinct antecedents contribute to security fatigue, which result in three unique consequences. We discuss security fatigue in relation to past theoretical views and related concepts within the security policy compliance literature and identify directions for future research.},

Taking the resource orchestration perspective as the theoretical lens, this study investigates the process for developing community capability. Two cases of community capability development in rural Chinese villages are studied. The findings reveal two settings for community capability development—government supported and self‐orchestrated—and show that community capability is developed through the individual capabilities of lead users and the resource orchestration interactions of stakeholders. This study has theoretical implications because it reveals the importance of developing community capability by orchestrating resources beyond merely providing training and education to rural community members and because it identifies the processes for developing community capability in the two respective settings. It also extends the resource orchestration perspective from a single‐firm context to a community context by revealing the resource orchestration interactions.},

Habermas also places particular emphasis on the importance of the public sphere in a democratic society, critiquing the role of the media and other actors in shaping public discourse. While there has been growing emphasis on critical discourse analysis (CDA), there has been limited effort to systematically apply Habermas’ validity claims to empirical research. Moreover, while critical research in information systems has examined communication within the organizational context, public discourse on information technology has received little attention. The paper makes three primary contributions: (1) it responds to Habermas’ call for empirical research to ground and extend his theory of communication in every day critical practice; (2) it proposes an approach to applying Habermas’ theory of communication to CDA; and (3) it extends the reach of critical research in information systems beyond micro‐level organizational concerns and opens up to critical reflection and debate on the impact of systematically distorted communication about technology in the public sphere.},

To illustrate each type, detailed case histories are used that analyse the reasons why specific IT sourcing decisions were adopted. Here, we consider total outsourcing at the London Stock Exchange; multiple‐supplier sourcing at ICI plc; joint venture project sourcing at CRESTCo Ltd; and insourcing at the Royal Bank of Scotland. The trend towards outsourcing is increasing in all industrial and commercial sectors. However, client organizations need to become more aware of some of the pitfalls, particularly in respect of large‐scale outsourcing deals to single or multiple suppliers. This is because the move to IT outsourcing engenders the need to develop new capabilities and skills to manage complex commercial contracts. We therefore conclude that, while many IT outsourcing contracts followed rationalization, cost‐cutting and disappointing results from in‐house IT provision, short‐termism and current uncertainties over market, business and political conditions pose problems for many organizations in deciding future outsourcing arrangements.},

Humans and algorithms interact with one another to accomplish work so that the algorithm takes on the role of a co‐worker. Human–algorithm interactions are characterised by problematic issues such as absence of mutually co‐constructed dialogue, lack of transparency regarding how algorithmic outputs are generated, and difficulty of over‐riding algorithmic directive – conditions that create lack of clarity for the human worker. This article examines human–algorithm role interactions in algorithmic work. Drawing on the theoretical framing of organisational roles, we theorise on the algorithm as role sender and the human as the role taker. We explain how the algorithm is a multi‐role sender with entangled roles, while the human as role taker experiences algorithm‐driven role conflict and role ambiguity. Further, while the algorithm records all of the human's task actions, it is ignorant of the human's cognitive reactions – it undergoes what we conceptualise as ‘broken loop learning’. The empirical context of our study is algorithm‐driven taxi driving (in the United States) exemplified by companies such as Uber. We draw from data that include interviews with 15 Uber drivers, a netnographic study of 1700 discussion threads among Uber drivers from two popular online forums, and analysis of Uber's web pages. Implications for IS scholarship, practice and policy are discussed.},

Because affect is central to this theorisation, we ensure that the model captures and explains differences in day‐to‐day affective constructs to account for the often fleeting nature of affective states. We test our multilevel model using an experience‐sampling methodology design, in which employees completed daily surveys over a 2‐week period, followed by a hierarchal linear modelling statistical assessment. Our contribution to theory is a unique account of ISP compliance that integrates affective factors with constructs from rational choice theory and theory of planned behaviour and that diverges from prior conceptualisations of ISP compliance as a purely stable and reason‐based phenomenon. For practitioners, our results suggest that a combination of cognitive and affective influences may produce discrete episodes of ISP compliance that do not coincide with prior behavioural trends.},

Moreover, existing research into EAI focuses on the technical and social conditions associated with EAI success and failure and, to a lesser extent, on the influence of interpersonal interactions between architects and their stakeholders through which the EAI is enacted. Against that backdrop, we examine EAI from the perspective of the architects and their stakeholders with a focus on how architects can build commitment to and support for implementation of the selected technology products and programmes. Specifically, we rely on communities of practice (CoP) theory to investigate two cases of EAI with a focus on practices that enabled or prevented the architects from building communities with requisite commitment to and support for their efforts. We find that whilst the involved architects were required to liaise with business and technology stakeholders, their practices did not allow them to effectively build the necessary connections, and their EAI initiatives suffered accordingly. As a result, we theorize the permeability of community boundaries around architects as key to the success of EAI: When architects prioritize what they think is important over the views and concerns of business and technology stakeholders community, a dominant intra‐CoP perspective will emerge, and boundaries around the community of architects will be reinforced, preventing stakeholders with legitimate interests in the EAI to influence the process; in contrast, when architects prioritize engaging with the viewpoints and concerns of business and technology stakeholders community, boundaries will become permeable, and an intercommunity CoP will emerge, enabling knowledge sharing and negotiations between everyone with legitimate interests in the EAI.},

   abstract                      = {In the seventies, Nolan was the first to address the need for a descriptive stage theory concerning the planning, organizing and controlling activities associated with managing the organizational computer resource. The arrival of newer technologies, such as those based on the Internet, calls for fresh approaches in terms of their implementation and management. Intranet technology, which is based on Internet technology, differs from other types of IT in terms of its characteristics, use and implementation. We propose a four‐stage model for intranet implementation and management. Each stage is portrayed by seven general characteristics. We propose that, in order to ensure intranet institutionalization, three existential crises must be overcome. First, if a sponsor does not nurture the intranet, it cannot evolve beyond its experimental beginnings. Second, if a critical mass of both users and content cannot be reached simultaneously, the intranet will not progress. Finally, if the intranet remains uncontrolled, it will be perceived to be useless, and therefore users will abandon it.},

   abstract                      = {In software platform ecosystems, the technological and structural peculiarities vest the platform owner with an extremely powerful position that puts any complementor at the mercy of the platform owner's actions. Paradoxically, it is the self‐determination and proactivity of the complementors that determine the ecosystem's success through their surprising outside innovations. This study addresses this power paradox by unpacking the power dynamics between platform owners and complementors. Based on an exploratory multiple‐case study of six platform partnerships, we find that power in platform ecosystems unfolds as a reciprocal process of three interlocking cycles, in which both the platform owner and the complementors take an active role. The modus operandi of power in platform ecosystems is a “central power cycle” in which the complementors repeatedly evaluate whether to accept or reject the platform owner's domination power. Thriving partnerships sustain this central power cycle over time, which requires that the platform owner and the complementors dynamically adapt their wielding of power to the changing needs of the partnership (partnership adaptation cycle) or the ecosystem (ecosystem redefinition cycle). For the platform owner, this entails the occasional use of manipulation to favour a particular partnership or redefining the ecosystem's framework and sporadically wielding coercion in favour of the broader ecosystem. For the complementor, this entails over‐subjectification to entice the platform owner to wield its power in favour of their partnership. Our findings have important implications for platform ecosystem and power theory, as well as managerial practice.},

A critical early activity is requirements definition, when the requirements for an information system are determined. Traditional requirements capture techniques do not support the collaborative nature of requirements definition or the emergent nature of requirements themselves. This paper focuses on viewpoint development as a means of resolving some of the difficulties of requirements definition. It proposes a user viewpoint model for capturing and representing the viewpoints of users during requirements acquisition. The model can facilitate communication and interaction between analysts and users and help build a shared understanding of requirements. It can be used to structure the requirements acquisition process. The model provides for evaluation of requirements acquisition techniques to guide the selection of appropriate techniques for developing user viewpoint models. The paper reports a multiple‐case study of requirements definition efforts that examined user viewpoint development in practice and used the cases to validate empirically the concepts of the user viewpoint model. The implications of the case study findings for requirements definition practice are discussed, and some areas for future research are identified.},

Interest in qualitative research methods such as action research, case study research and ethnography, which focus on understanding social phenomena in their natural setting, has consequently grown. Case study research is the most widely used qualitative research method in information systems research, and is well suited to understanding the interactions between information technology‐related innovations and organizational contexts. Although case study research is useful as a means of studying information systems development and use in the field, there can be practical difficulties associated with attempting to undertake case studies as a rigorous and effective method of research. This paper addresses a number of these difficulties and offers some practical guidelines for successfully completing case study research. The paper focuses on the pragmatics of conducting case study research, and draws from the discussion at a panel session conducted by the authors at the 8th Australasian Conference on Information Systems, September 1997 (ACIS 97), from the authors' practical experiences, and from the case study research literature.},

We theorise that organisations that have a high extent of employing a centralised (decentralised) open innovation approach and a high IT use intensity for external (internal) information flows are likely to have a high extent of exploratory (exploitative) innovation. We further posit that harnessing exploratory and exploitative innovation can lead to organisational innovation performance. This theory was validated through a field survey involving 186 organisations. The findings from this study advance the IT and open innovation literature by gaining an understanding of the interplay among different open innovation search approaches and IT use, and the resulting variances in innovation performance in terms of new product sales and patents.},

We first interviewed five frontline employees and then surveyed 221 employees that were different from the interview sample from eight organisations. All participants utilised a similar version of internet‐of‐things (IoT) in their daily work. We find that (a) exploitative use has a stronger influence on DC for women than for men, while explorative use displays a higher impact on DC for men than for women, and (b) technology digital affordance (TDA), digital knowledge (DK), and task variety (TV) exhibit significant influences on both exploitative and explorative uses to varying extents. The post‐hoc analysis reveals that exploitative use mediates the influences of TDA and DK on DC only for women; explorative use mediates the impacts of TDA and TV on DC only for men. Our study advances the understandings of the downstream impact of technology use in the digital context.},

However, when these systems have to be discontinued, users face challenges regarding how to stop relying on their legacy habits. Despite their importance, we know little about how legacy habits shape the way users discontinue a legacy system. Through a comparative case‐study approach, in a large mortgage firm and an international telecommunication company, we identify three roles that these habits play during the discontinuance process. We demonstrate that legacy habits not only play an ‘inhibiting’ role by keeping users attached to legacy systems; they also play a ‘bridging’ role by acting as a common ground for users to start working with a new system and a ‘deterring’ role when users resent certain habits of working with the legacy systems, despite their orientation to keep relying on these habits. We contribute to the IS habit literature by extending the roles of legacy habits beyond an inhibiting role. We also enrich the conceptualisation of legacy habits beyond the individual level by showing that the socio‐technical conditions in which the habits are embedded impact the emergence and evolution of their roles during the discontinuance process. We discuss the implications of our findings for theorising and managing IS discontinuance process.},

However, it is unclear how the DSR community could benefit from the replication of design theories. Similarly, the goal of design theories is to obtain utility instead of truth raises questions regarding the transferability of replication into the DSR domain. Against this background, this study reflects on the function, outcome, and impact of replications, to understand whether the replication of design theories is possible and necessary. The study proposes that replication can be an important catalyst for reuse and knowledge accumulation in DSR because it provides evidence on the boundaries of design theory.

   abstract                      = {The development and utilisation of new information and communication technologies presents opportunities and risks, which bring ethical issues to the forefront. Any attempt to minimise the potential negative consequences to individuals, organisations and society resulting from the use of these technologies is challenging. In order to address these challenges, this paper presents an ethics‐by‐design approach that has been developed and implemented in the context of Decision Supports Systems for Emergency Management. Such systems help manage large and cross‐border disasters by supporting decision makers to respond on emergencies in a reasonable way by taking follow‐up actions into account. The approach taken in this paper specifically provides means to support the ethical dimensions of these decisions. Actions taken during disasters can have ramifications that persist long after a disaster has passed. The ethics‐by‐design approach presented here not only informs the design of systems, but also considers the role and training of the decision makers in the design process. The paper builds on the literature on ethics in information systems and makes a contribution to theory by providing a framework to ensure ethical considerations are embedded into the design of systems.},

Despite the growing prominence of canonical action research (CAR) in the information systems discipline, a paucity of methodological guidance continues to hamper those conducting and evaluating such studies. This article elicits a set of five principles and associated criteria to help assure both the rigor and the relevance of CAR in information systems. The first principle relates to the development of an agreement that facilitates collaboration between the action researcher and the client. The second principle is based upon a cyclical process model for action research that consists of five stages: diagnosis, planning, intervention, evaluation and reflection. Additional principles highlight the critical roles of theory, change through action, and the specification of learning in terms of implications for both research and practice. The five principles are illustrated through the analysis of one recently published CAR study.},

Structured methods, for instance, have been widely championed as providing a way of improving the quality of software systems. In this paper a case study is presented in which a mail order company made an attempt to implement a well‐known methodology, Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM). Far from facilitating the development process, SSADM encouraged a rigid and mechanical approach in which the methodology was applied in a ritualistic way which inhibited creative thinking. The argument is thus, that methodology, although its influence may be benign, has the potential to operate as a ‘social defence’, i.e. as a set of organizational rituals with the primary function of containing anxiety. The grandiose illusion of an all‐powerful method allows practitioners to deny their feelings of impotence in the face of the daunting technical and political challenges of systems development. By withdrawing into this fantasy world the learning processes that are critical to the success of systems development are jeopardized. Methodology, whilst masquerading as the epitome of rationality, may thus operate as an irrational ritual, the enactment of which provides designers with a feeling of security and efficiency at the expense of real engagement with the task at hand.},

They thereby support earlier research, which claims significance between attitudes and behaviour, by eliminating the potentially mediating effects of task and phase.

Relying on a qualitative study that consists of the analysis of 12 interviews, 14 142 messages extracted from online forums, and 30 blogs, we explore the discourses associated with the usage of QS technologies. Our findings indicate that self‐quantification has ambivalent, conflicting effects—13 empowering and 11 disempowering—spanning the dimensions of power, knowledge, body and space. Our research also shows the emergence of micro‐surveillance of oneself, which we name the heautopticon. The implications of this critical research also offer possibilities for change by discussing social and individual emancipation.},

   abstract                      = {Information systems (IS) support in organizations has undergone dramatic changes over the years. IS professionals in the support function have become an important knowledge source to colleagues who seek assistance with their IS usage. Our understanding of IS professionals' customer‐oriented behaviours is limited, however. Focusing on IS post‐implementation support and drawing upon organizational citizenship behaviour (OCB) theory, this paper seeks to understand IS professionals' citizenship behaviours in supporting colleagues. Our analysis of 630 support tasks performed by IS professionals with regard to two systems at three periods reveals five types of customer‐oriented OCB: anticipation, education, justification, personalization‐technology and personalization‐business. Our results also show different associations between four contextual factors of IS support (i.e. system, user, task and problem) and the OCBs. In instances of user deficiency, more personalization‐business and anticipation OCBs were observed across all the four problem domains (functionality, data, workflow and role). By contrast, in instances of system deficiency, more personalization‐technology OCBs were observed among the two problem domains of data and functionality. Moreover, the occurrence of OCBs revealed a temporal pattern such that personalization‐business OCBs are more pronounced in early post‐implementation periods whereas anticipation OCBs and personalization‐technology OCBs become more dominant later. The categorization scheme of the customer‐oriented OCB, the OCB dynamics and the patterns between OCB types and the contextual factors advance our understanding of the evolving and challenging work of organizational IS support. Our findings extend the OCB literature on customer orientation and enrich the limited studies on knowledge‐intensive IS support work. Practical implications of the findings on IS management and policies are discussed.},

Borrowing theoretical insights on information behaviour accumulated over 50 years of information studies research, a conceptual framework is presented to help understand and assess the social and organizational impacts of internet‐based IS. The framework describes the use of internet‐based IS as a dynamic cycle of information needs–seeking–use activity situated in the context of a firm's information environment. Research questions pertain to the process of how individuals in organizations seek and use information from internet‐based IS to satisfy information needs. In terms of information needs, this involves understanding the problem situations that lead participants to use internet‐based IS, as well as the characteristics of those problems beyond subject matter. With respect to information seeking, this involves analysing how information from internet‐based systems is displayed and formatted to signal their potential usefulness. In terms of information use, this involves how information obtained from internet‐based systems is used in practice to resolve or redefine problems. Both quantitative and qualitative research methods are used. Data collection involves web tracking to identify significant episodes of internet‐based IS activity, as well as one‐on‐one interviews to explore the context behind these episodes. Results suggest that it is possible and valuable to identify scenarios of internet‐based IS use dominant in an organizational work setting. Doing so can help to identify ways to improve the situated use of internet‐based IS that ameliorate the information needs–seeking–use cycle in firms.},

A large part of IS security research is technical in nature with limited consideration of people and organizational issues. The study presented in this paper adopts a broader perspective and presents an understanding of IS security in terms of the values of people from an organizational perspective. It uses the value‐focused thinking approach to identify ‘fundamental’ objectives for IS security and ‘means’ of achieving them in an organization. Data for the study were collected through in‐depth interviews with 103 managers about their values in managing IS security. Interview results suggest 86 objectives that are essential in managing IS security. The 86 objectives are organized into 25 clusters of nine fundamental and 16 means categories. These results are validated by a panel of seven IS security experts. The findings suggest that for maintaining IS security in organizations, it is necessary to go beyond technical considerations and adopt organizationally grounded principles and values.},

Further, we draw on a temporal theory of human agency to explain how current dilemmas and contingencies, cultural identities and connections to the past, and future expectations and aspirations shape resettled refugees' enactment of these patterns of ICT‐mediated information practices.

This study uses narrative inquiry to provide temporal, contextualised accounts of IT professional experiences from the Indigenous (Māori) community in Aotearoa, New Zealand. These accounts demonstrate how participants actively draw from their culture to enact their professional activities. We identify three cultural elements that differentiate the practices of Māori IT professionals from Western approaches that dominate the IS literature: whakapapa (genealogical connections), tikanga (customary traditions) and tino rangatiratanga (collective cultural determination). Further, we theorise how Indigenous IT professionals capitalise on the re‐presentational power of digital artefacts as a vehicle for cultural re‐affirmation to project their Indigenous identity in contemporary society. Our findings are useful for attempts to enhance Indigenous representation in the IT workforce and for designing systems and artefacts that are relevant to and inclusive for Indigenous communities.},

In this study, we examine the cross‐cultural differences between South Korea and the United States in user behaviour towards protective information technologies. We develop a theoretical model of user behaviour based on the framework of the theory of planned behaviour and national cultural dimensions and indices. We posit that cultural factors moderate the strength of the relationships in the behavioural model in the context of protective information technologies. The model was then empirically tested using structural equation modelling techniques in conjunction with multi‐group analysis. Most of the hypothesized moderating effects of national cultural factors were found to be statistically significant. Our findings suggest that cultural factors should be considered in order to design effective information security policies, practices and technologies in global networks where multiple cultures coexist.

OSS is particularly valuable to meet the needs of numerous disadvantaged users for whom proprietary software is not affordable. While OSS projects are lack of formal organizational structure, project leaders play a significant role in initiating and managing these projects and eventually, influencing the degree to which the developed software is used and liked by users. Drawing on resource dependence theory, we investigate the impacts of two team‐level characteristics of OSS project leaders (ie, size and tenure) on how well the developed software can address users' needs, with regard to the quantity of software being used by users and the quality of software to users' satisfaction. Further, from a resource dependence perspective, we examine the moderating role of project leaders' network ties in shaping the contingency of these effects. By using a large‐scale dataset from 43 048 OSS development projects in SourceForge community, we find empirical evidence corroborating our theory. Taken together, our findings suggest the boundary‐spanning role of project leaders in developing digital social innovation.},

However, doctors were not the passive subjects of a computerized control system, and some were able to resist the application of the information produced by challenging its validity or using it to argue for more resources. Nevertheless, the interrelatedness of the information system with the organizational forms and practices within which it was used and which it helped shape reinforced the concepts, norms and values associated with the new management and economic discourse prevalent in the hospital, and helped to produce more defined accountabilities for doctors. With time, the role of the information system was reinterpreted, and in the face of continued resistance by doctors, it was relegated to a less significant role. The potential for engendering self‐disciplining behaviour in organizational participants through the pervasive, everyday use of the information the system produced likewise diminished.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. Many recent studies have shown that computer‐based systems continue to ‘fail’ at a number of different levels (Romtec, 1988; KPMG, 1990) and it is increasingly apparent (Maclaren et al., 1991) that the most serious failures of information technology (IT) lie in the continuing inability to address those concerns which are central to the successful achievement of individual, organizational and social goals. It is the contention of this paper that this failing is precisely because these are the areas which are ignored or inadequately treated by conventional system development methods. There is, of course, a vast body of literature concerned with the understanding of complex human activity systems. This literature often reflects a mass of contradictions at the epistemological and the ontological level about the behaviour of such systems and has also spawned numerous methods (and methodologies) which seek to guide the individual in making successful interventions into organizational situations (Rosenhead, 1989). Despite this multiplicity of viewpoints many writers have posited a dichotomy between so‐called 'soft and ‘hard’ approaches to problem situations and use this dichotomy to inform the choice of an appropriate problem‐solving methodology (Checkland, 1985). In this paper we characterize these two approaches as being concerned with either the purpose(s) of the human activity system (i.e. ‘doing the right thing’) or with the design of the efficient means of achieving such purpose(s) (i.e. ‘doing the thing right’). It is our belief that much of the literature and work in either area has not concerned itself with the issues of the other. Writers on ‘hard’ engineering methods often assume the question of purpose to be either straightforward (e.g. given in the project brief) or, paradoxically, too difficult (e.g. it is not our concern as mere systems analysts). Writers on ‘soft’ methods on the other hand rarely have anything to say about the design and implementation of well‐engineered computer‐based systems, giving the impression that this is a somewhat mundane activity better left to technical experts. This paper, therefore, attempts to set out a rationale for the bringing together of principles from both ‘hard’ engineering and ‘soft’ inquiry methods without doing epistemological damage to either. To illustrate our argument we concentrate on JSD (Jackson system development) as an example of system engineering (Cameron, 1983) and SSM (soft systems methodology) as an example of system inquiry (Checkland, 1981; Checkland & Scholes, 1990). Our general thesis, however, does not depend upon either of these two approaches per se but applies to the overall issue of bringing together insights from two apparently opposed epistemological positions in an effort better to harness the power of IT in pursuit of purposeful human activity.},

With this aim, video games can be an insightful source of inspiration, as they are specifically designed to maximise playing time, increase players' intentions of playing during the day or enhance their willingness to replay. In a gaming context, ‘time’ is an important factor for engagement because game designers can design the game time to retain players in the game environment. Drawing on social practice theory, which is increasingly used in Information Systems (IS) research, I conducted an ethnographic study in World of Warcraft (WoW) to understand how various temporalities are produced within a video game and the effects that they have on players' engagement. The findings show that game temporalities stem from the complex interaction between the design features of the game and the norms, routines and expectations that are part of the game practices. Moreover, these temporalities can engender temporal experiences that may stimulate engagement in various ways. The study contributes to IS literature by proposing a novel understanding of how time can be intentionally designed to sustain user engagement. Finally, it suggests that ‘time design’ in video games could inspire designs in broader IS contexts, such as in the gamification of online communities, crowdsourcing platforms and crowd working systems.},

Law enforcement agencies, non‐profit organisations, and social entrepreneurs increasingly are using information technology as a resource to locate, identify, and rescue victims and find, arrest, and convict traffickers. In this qualitative case study, we partnered with a non‐profit organisation that trains law enforcement officers to use information technology to counter sex trafficking. For this research study, we observed training courses, interviewed law enforcement officers and non‐profit staff, and reviewed technology usage logs and other data sources. Some officers readily used the new information technology post‐training, while others failed to use the new technology. Using conservation of resources theory as a sensitising lens, we identify two factors affecting the use of new technology post‐training: the level of organisational resources available to individuals and the individual's perceptions of the new information technology as a resource. With these findings, we develop the Resources Model of Information Technology Use to explain how perceptions of organisational and technology resources affect information technology usage patterns and outcomes.},

   abstract                      = {Algorithmic fairness (AF) has been framed as a newly emerging technology that mitigates systemic discrimination in automated decision‐making, providing opportunities to improve fairness in information systems (IS). However, based on a state‐of‐the‐art literature review, we argue that fairness is an inherently social concept and that technologies for AF should therefore be approached through a sociotechnical lens. We advance the discourse on AF as a sociotechnical phenomenon. Our research objective is to embed AF in the sociotechnical view of IS . Specifically, we elaborate on why outcomes of a system that uses algorithmic means to assure fairness depend on mutual influences between technical and social structures. This perspective can generate new insights that integrate knowledge from both technical fields and social studies. Further, it spurs new directions for IS debates. We contribute as follows: First, we problematize fundamental assumptions in the current discourse on AF based on a systematic analysis of 310 articles. Second, we respond to these assumptions by theorizing AF as a sociotechnical construct. Third, we propose directions for IS researchers to enhance their impacts by pursuing a unique understanding of sociotechnical AF. We call for and undertake a holistic approach to AF. A sociotechnical perspective on AF can yield holistic solutions to systemic biases and discrimination.},

We classify game affordances, gamer orientations, and in‐game items into two dimensions according to the instrumental–hedonic dichotomy. Utilising the affordance theory, we propose that the fit between game affordances and gamer orientation determines game identification, whereas the fit between game identification and gamer orientations determines in‐game purchases. We test the proposed model using a two‐wave longitudinal survey. The results suggest that instrumental gamer orientation strengthens the relationship between instrumental game affordances and game identification as well as the relationship between game identification and instrumental in‐game purchase. A hedonic gamer orientation strengthens the relationship between hedonic game affordances and game identification as well as the relationship between game identification and hedonic in‐game purchases. This paper identifies different types of game affordances and gamer orientations and examines the interactions between the two, advancing the theoretical understanding of proactive behaviours in free‐to‐play games.},

However, this is a contentious issue, as an intranet is deemed to be an empowering technology. Consequently, intranet control systems must balance empowerment and control so as not to negate each other. This paper investigates intranet control activities and their effect on users’ perceptions of empowerment throughout the evolution of an intranet in Hewlett Packard (Ireland). The growth of the intranet is charted as a six‐stage model that illustrates an evolution of purpose, control and empowerment. The control strategies for managing the intranet implemented at each stage are investigated, and their resultant effects on empowerment are evaluated. The study reveals the importance of balancing control strategies with empowerment initiatives in managing intranet environments. Based on the evidence available, the study recommends the implementation of specific controls at particular stages in the evolution of an intranet in order to achieve control systems that balance empowerment and control.},

Such people are perceived as important in enabling organizations to exploit information systems effectively in today's competitive business environment. Based on a literature survey this paper summarizes what we know about hybrid managers, as expressed by both ‘expert opinion’ and formal research studies. We conclude that little substantive research has been conducted into hybrid managers. Much has still to be learnt about their possible role, characteristics and competences; and how organizations should recruit and develop them. Because of the paucity of published material about ‘hybrids’ in the information systems context, we have drawn inferences from appropriate analogues in other functions — namely personnel, finance and R&D. Relevant studies in related areas of information systems, general management, careers and management development are also put into the ‘hybrid’ context.},

Against this backdrop, we analyze existing knowledge on business model design and management, resulting in a first systematization of the activities that are necessary for developing and managing new business models. In order to complement this knowledge and to identify the requirements for supporting these activities, a series of expert interviews is conducted. Based on the results of the interview series, a new business model development tool is created and evaluated. The learnings of this development process are then consolidated in a unified framework. This framework constitutes a new solution for systematically designing tool support for business model development and extends existing literature by highlighting the importance of collaboration between participants in a business model development project. It also provides designers of new business model development tool with an empirically based conceptualization to guide their efforts.},

Social representations of work are important as reflexive agents may see contradictions between these and their use of technology in practice, thus providing a trigger for change. However, agents do not always see contradictions, which allows them to endure by favouring practice reproduction. To explain this inconsistency, this paper introduces the concept of doxa as a sensitising device for a practice analysis of call centre work and examines the narratives developed by advisors to represent their call‐handling practices. The contributions of our doxa‐informed practice analysis to the literature on IS and work practices include the following: firstly, to indicate how a simultaneous presence and absence of agents' reflexivity occurs; secondly, to demonstrate how the sensemaking function provided by social representations of work and technology can be undermined; and finally to show how material conditions of work and organisation may remain hidden, despite being directly implicated in the logic of practice.},

Ontologies are understood either in the philosophical sense as firm metaphysical commitments or in the looser sense of dictionaries or taxonomies. This paper critically examines the understanding and use of ontologies and knowledge representation languages in information systems (IS) research and application. As ontologies are intended to be conceptualizations of a perceived reality, they should reflect the empirically observed reality. This motivates proposing psychology of language as a reference discipline for knowledge engineering and knowledge management. Natural language is argued to reflect the cognitive concepts we use to think about and perceive the world around us. These cognitive concepts are the relevant terms with which to structure and represent knowledge about the world. Psychology of language can provide empirical justification for a particular set of concepts to represent knowledge. This paper draws on psycho‐linguistic research to develop a proposal for a system of cognitive structures. This is argued to provide the relevant concepts on which to found knowledge representation schemata for knowledge engineering, knowledge management and conceptual modelling.},

These domains are often categorised into stacked levels, namely the national, the organisational and the individual, or divided into a domain of action and an overarching context. We argue in this paper that an assumption of embeddedness underlies many of these dominant approaches and we identify three issues with this assumption, namely reductionism, unidirectional causality and marginalisation. We draw from the ontological and methodological principles of actor‐network theory to suggest a shift towards a more fluid view of the dynamics between the different domains of change. We support our discussion by a case study of the modernisation of the justice system in Morocco, including a national computerisation project of case processing in the courts.},

Using Wittgenstein's concept of language games, we examine how participants of two online forums construct collective identity and culture through their discursive practices. We suggest a strong performative interpretation of the notion of language games, i.e. members of a community produce a sense of we‐ness through their participation in the language game while also defining their expected behaviours and actions. We illustrate how the notion of language games offers an approach for researching and analysing the emergence of collective identity and culture in online forums.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. As companies race to digitize physical‐based service processes repackaging them as online e‐services, it becomes increasingly important to understand how consumers perceive the digitized e‐service alternative. We theorize that consumers often perceive e‐services as being artificial and non‐authentic, and that consumers must perform this assessment when deciding whether new e‐services are viable alternatives to traditional service methods. This research investigates whether consumer perceptions of artificiality increase perceptions of e‐service risk, which has been shown to hamper consumer acceptance in a variety of online settings. An empirical study operationalized perceived artificiality (PA) within a controlled laboratory experiment that manipulated the risk of a specific e‐service class (e‐payments). For a specific e‐service brand, PA is reduced when the web interface is viewed as easy to use; alternatively, PA is increased when consumers have relatively high risk perceptions about the overall e‐service class. Furthermore, consumers who were rated as information technology innovators had lower overall artificiality perceptions, however, exposure to negatively framed e‐service efficacy information removed this artificiality reducing effect. The theoretical linkages between PA and perceived risk, and the two antecedents – ease of use and e‐service class risk – were confirmed by survey results. The implications of these results for future research as well as the design and marketing of e‐services are examined.},

In this paper, we question how the blogging practices of development professionals shape such ICT4D discourse. Through a combination of interviews and analyses of blog contents, we examine two major purposes of blogging: reflecting upon development practices and engaging with a self‐selected audience. Our analyses reveal that these two purposes were interwoven in ways that contributed to making bloggers' ICT4D discourse innovative but oriented towards a small community of peers rather than a larger audience. Through blogging, development professionals refined their expertise on ICT4D. As they did so, they also generated a personal speaker's corner that primarily attracted like‐minded peers rather than promoting larger participation in ICT4D discourse. This research contributes to the emerging literature on social media practices by showing how blogging practices enable the formation of what a discourse is about, and by highlighting differences between perceived and actual levels of interactions between bloggers and their audience. The paper also adds to the ICT and development literatures by revealing that blogging practices can deepen ICT4D discourse, but that they do not necessarily enhance participation in development. Such insight is crucial for development professionals to develop realistic expectations of blogging for ICT4D.},

However, given the well‐documented ‘software crisis’, success is far from guaranteed for systems development projects. Many researchers see the solution to the software crisis in terms of increased control and the more widespread adoption of rigorous and formalized system development methodologies. This paper presents some arguments and pressures which support the use of methodologies and some evidence of the literature bias which favours methodologies is provided. However the problems associated with the use of methodologies have not perhaps received as much attention in previous research. This paper identifies a number of arguments and pressures which question the value of methodologies, and reports the results of a field study which investigated the role of methodologies in practice. The critical perspective adopted throughout shows that, contrary to the predominant view in literature, the assumption that increased adoption of methodologies addresses the problems inherent in systems development is by no means proven.},

Among the main findings to emerge are the following. There is a wide difference between the formalized sequence of steps and stages prescribed by a methodology and the methodology‐in‐action uniquely enacted for each development project. Also, there is much evidence which suggests that developers omit certain aspects of methodologies not from a position of ignorance, but from the more pragmatic basis that certain aspects are not relevant to the development environment they face. Thus, methodologies are tailored to the needs of the prevailing development environment and, being documented in a single manual often, are framed at a higher level of granularity that specifies broad activities and objectives, rather than specifying in a very detailed fashion the exact manner in which development should take place. Additionally, the findings clarify the apparently contradictory position in the literature as to whether developer experience is positively or negatively correlated with methodology use. The study would suggest that experienced developers are likely to use methodologies, albeit ones which have been heavily customized to the exigencies of the particular situation.},

Our exploratory, multiple‐case study of 4 platforms illustrates how “knowledge boundaries” emerge between platform owners and complementors. We observe that knowledge boundaries are influenced by a platform's functional extent, interface design, and evolutionary dynamics, which create differences, dependencies, and novelty of development knowledge, resulting in qualitatively distinct types of knowledge boundaries. To overcome knowledge boundaries, platform owners provide various resources at the boundary, including information portals, documentation, helpdesks, and alignment workshops. We observe that in shaping these resources, platform owners face a trade‐off between providing knowledge at the right scope, while allowing for the scalability of knowledge resources for the entire ecosystem. Depending on their scope and scale, we classify knowledge boundary resources as broadcasting, brokering, and bridging, each representing qualitatively distinct patterns in managing knowledge in platform ecosystems. We conclude with implications for researchers and managers.},

The qualitative data, consisting of interviews and observations, were analysed to capture the mediating role of social media for information sharing within and across work activities. We found social media in general helpful to maintain coherence in terms of sharing work‐related information, improving ambient awareness, as well as for socialising, but they also caused inconsistencies in use and adoption. In addition, we found that social media served different purposes in different activity systems, causing both contradictions and congruencies; what was seen as a benefit for some work activities appeared as a limitation for others (eg, concerning pace and aims of information sharing). In our findings through the lens of activity theory, we observed how objects, although they were shared, were fractionalised in networked activities. Our conclusion is that despite the still unoptimised functionality, social media do bring coherence in work activities in a decentralised work environment.},

However, the potentially transformative influence of m‐health is limited, as many older adults resist adoption leading to the emergence of an age‐based digital divide. This study leverages protection motivation theory and social cognitive theory to explore the factors driving resistance among older adults. This mixed methods study integrates survey findings with insights from qualitative interviews to highlight that the m‐health digital divide is deepening due to older adults' perceived inability to adopt and their unwillingness to adopt stemming from mistrust, high risk perceptions, and strong desire for privacy. The paper contributes to the privacy and social inclusion literature by demonstrating that while many older adults have access to m‐health, they are currently excluded and require careful consideration by technology organizations and researchers. The study provides recommendations for narrowing the m‐health digital divide through inclusive design and educational efforts to improve self‐efficacy, develop privacy literacy, and build trust, thereby ensuring that older citizens are both capable and willing to adopt.},

However, the increased use of virtual teams has not been accompanied by concomitant research efforts to understand better the social‐psychological contributors to effective virtual teams. In this paper, we use a model of group effectiveness to propose a possible research agenda examining sources of virtual team effectiveness. Although much of this model offers insights relevant to the virtual environment, differences between groups and teams and between co‐located and virtual environments suggest that modifications and additions to this model may be necessary. We offer a set of research propositions to advance future research on effective virtual teams beyond anecdote and description.

   abstract                      = {Abstract. The original ‘stages of growth’ model, as applied to the field of Information Systems (Gibson & Nolan, 1974), may be viewed as seminal, given the influence it has had on both theory and practice (Nolan, 1984; Sullivan, 1985; Ward, et al., 1990). This is so, despite the model's lack of substantiation based on empirical evidence, the overly simplistic assumptions on which it is based, and the limited focus of the original concept (Benbasat, et al., 1984; King & Kraemer, 1984). Since its first appearance, the model has been refined following many applications (Nolan, 1979, 1984). In addition, others have developed ‘stages of growth’ models of their own. For example, Somogyi & Galliers, (1987a, b)provide a model depicting the move from basic data processing systems to strategic information systems, tracing the early days of commercial applications of computing through to the present day (Ward et al. 1990). Earl (1983, 1986, 1988, 1989) proposes a stages‐model for information systems planning, as does Bhabuta (1988), while Hirschheim, et al. (1988) have developed a more broadly focused model associated with the development of the information‐systems management function. As a result of a review of the above and of a case study research undertaken in Perth, Western Australia, a revised model was developed, which takes account of current thinking and past experience in the application of the various ‘stages of growth’ models (Sutherland & Galliers, 1989). This paper sets out to review some of these models and proceeds to describe the process of developing, testing and applying the revised ‘stages of growth’ model. The model is more broadly focused than the original concept, incorporating strategic, organizational, human resource and management considerations. As a result, it is argued that this model has greater utility than its predecessors.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. Many organization theorists have predicted the emergence of the networked or virtual firm as a model for the design of future organizations. Researchers have also emphasized the importance of trust as a necessary condition for ensuring the success of virtual organizations. This paper examines the open source software (OSS) ‘movement’ as an example of a virtual organization and proposes a model that runs contrary to the belief that trust is critical for virtual organizations. Instead, I argue that various control mechanisms can ensure the effective performance of autonomous agents who participate in virtual organizations. Borrowing from the theory of the ‘McDonaldization’ of society, I argue that, given a set of practices to ensure the control, efficiency, predictability and calculability of processes and outcomes in virtual organizations, effective performance may occur in the absence of trust. As support for my argument, I employ content analysis to examine a set of published case studies of OSS projects. My results show that, although that trust is rarely mentioned, ensuring control is an important criterion for effective performance within OSS projects. The case studies feature few references to other dimensions of McDonaldization (efficiency, predictability and calculability), however, and I conclude that the OSS movement relies on many other forms of social control and self‐control, which are often unacknowledged in OSS projects. Through these implicit forms of control, OSS projects are able to secure the cooperation of the autonomous agents that participate in project teams. I conclude by extrapolating from these case studies to other virtual organizations.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. To survive and thrive in today's competitive marketplace, organizations are increasingly migrating to new organizational structures in which partnerships and interorganizational systems (IOSs) are becoming more important. The success of these partnerships depends on both trust and control – complex constructs that act on and shape each other over time. Many organizations assume that high levels of trust are necessary for net‐enabled electronic partnerships. We examine this assumption from two perspectives: the initial decision to enter into a partnership or alliance, and its ongoing operation. Our findings suggest that researchers have treated trust simplistically, failing to distinguish the need for trust (which is inversely related to the organization's ability to control its partners) and the level of trust (which is an actual quantity that may change during the lifetime of the partnership). In many organizations, there is a gap between these two trust dimensions, which management attempts to close by changing the level of control. In this process, the IOS is key. To understand the relationship of IOS use to trust and control, we applied structured content analysis and analytic induction to 16 published case studies and used the results to create a framework for relating trust and control. At the heart of the framework is the recognition that trust and control are not simple substitutes for each other. Rather, they form a dialectic, where it makes sense to consider each construct only in relationship to the other. Using the framework, we identify areas for follow‐up research and suggestions for practitioners.},

Although user participation in systems development is widely believed to have positive impacts on user acceptance, it does not guarantee success and there is still much that we do not know about how and why user participation sometimes delivers positive benefits, but not always. Much of the prior research on user participation assumes that user–developer communication will ensure that the resulting system will be designed to meet users’ needs and will be accepted by them. The nature and quality of the communication between users and developers, however, remains an understudied aspect of user participation. In this paper, we focus on the user–developer communication process. We propose a process model that delineates four stages of communication between users and software developers, and we argue that these stages must occur for user participation to lead to effective outcomes. To illustrate our model, we apply it to analyse a ‘critical case study’ of a software project that failed despite high levels of user involvement. We show that when ‘communication lapses’ occurred in several of the user–developer communication stages, developers failed to be informed regarding the underlying reasons that users avoided the system. Based on the insights from this case study, we advise researchers and practitioners how to leverage the potential benefits of user participation, rather than take them for granted.},

Drawing upon actor‐network theory, this article analyses the socio‐technological construction of China's strategy for the telecommunications market transformation. We define the telecommunications market as the non‐human actor. The public and society, the state, and the operators constitute three groups of human actors representing the social interests in the telecommunications industry. We have observed that these actors’ interests are influenced by the situation of technology advance, the telecommunications development level, the macro reform progress and the national policies concerning the political and economic systems, and the international trend in telecommunications reforms. Owing to the dynamics of these contextual elements and the struggle of actors to inscribe their interests into the national strategy, China has transformed the telecommunications market by four stages, each stage with specific foci. Our case study demonstrates that the applications of actor‐network theory can be extended to investigate the formulation of a national strategy. The research design in which the social and technological contexts are dynamically connected with strategy formulation can be drawn upon by other actor‐network studies.},

Little is known about the development and implementation of indigenous technology in the developing world. This paper investigates China's experience of developing and deploying wireless local‐area network (WLAN) standards. First, drawing upon actor‐network theory, I interpret WLAN Authentication and Privacy Infrastructure (WAPI) standardization as a process of the actor‐network formation. Specifically, different actors were enrolled into two counter‐networks, namely the defensive network and the challenging network. These actors and the two counter‐networks struggled to dominate the interest inscriptions in the strategy of WLAN standardization. China's WAPI initiative failed because it could not establish a strong defensive network. Furthermore, I analyse the social, institutional and technological elements that determined the process of WAPI standardization. This case study demonstrates that counter‐network is a useful concept to analyse the mechanism of actor‐network formation. My analytical model in which the macro contexts are connected with the micro network dynamics can be drawn upon by other actor‐network studies on technology design and implementation. Practical implications for developing countries to develop the indigenous technologies have been given.},

Through a survey of 136 SDOs, which adopted Internet technologies during 1995‐2006, we empirically verify that these classes also determine different ways that SDOs innovate around software services they provide to their clients.

It seems that companies struggle to satisfy these competing demands, and neglecting either could have detrimental effects on their success. Different streams of research underline the importance of either privacy protection or the collection and use of customer information. But they remain largely silent about the resulting challenges that companies face. In this study, we address this gap by exploring how companies perceive and handle the tensions between their organizational information needs that necessitate some degree of privacy intrusion and their need to attract and retain customers, which requires privacy protection. We develop a grounded theory that explains how companies balance these opposing demands from an organizational perspective. More specifically, we identify four challenging tensions that define the conditions under which companies must operate. We find that companies try to achieve and maintain a state of balance in the presence of these tensions, and we discover three categories of tactics that help companies in their balancing acts. Our research contributes to a provider‐centric perspective on information privacy and uncovers the management of customer information and privacy as a new but important context in which organizational ambidexterity is required. We offer a detailed perspective on the specific challenges that companies face with respect to customer information and privacy, and our results can guide managers who have to deal with these challenges.},

While DESN are, in part, the technology that supports the necessary actions for engagement, they are also the people and behaviours that constitute its community. Through the presentation of new methodological considerations towards Digg, a large DESN, we observe that social networks entail practices of engagement, change and evolution within a DESN community. We reveal how engagement is a communal endeavour and that the clash of socio‐technical trajectories can result in the emergence of new paths of member participation. Our findings demonstrate the potential of netnography and impressionist tales for contributing to the ongoing pluralistic investigations of DESN and also inform research on engagement and community design and change.},

We examined this model with survey data from 149 data analysts in firms that use big data to varying degrees. The findings show that big data characteristics have distinct effects on knowledge hiding behaviours. While data volume and velocity enhance knowledge hiding, data variety reduces it. Moreover, evasive hiding, playing dumb, and rationalized hiding have varying effects on firm decision quality. Whereas evasive hiding reduces firm decision‐making quality, playing dumb does not affect it, and rationalized hiding improves it. These results are further validated with applicability checks. Ultimately, these results can explain inconsistent past findings regarding the return on investment in big data and provide a unique look into the potential “dark sides” of big data.},

To this end, this paper proposes a theoretical model that centres on two drivers behind boundary resources design and use – resourcing and securing – and how these drivers interact in third‐party development. We apply the model to a detailed case study of Apple's iPhone platform. Our application of the model not only serves as an illustration of its plausibility but also generates insights about the conflicting goals of third‐party development: the maintenance of platform control and the transfer of design capability to third‐party developers. We generate four specialised constructs for understanding the actions taken by stakeholders in third‐party development: self‐resourcing, regulation‐based securing, diversity resourcing and sovereignty securing. Our research extends and complements existing platform literature and contributes new knowledge about an alternative form of system development.},

Based on an in‐depth multi‐case study of four software projects, we investigate how project managers, developers, testers and user representatives think about barriers to effective knowledge sharing in agile development. Adapting comparative causal mapping, we constructed causal maps for each of the four roles and identified overlap and divergence in map constructs and causal linkages. The results indicate that despite certain similarities, the four roles differ in how they perceive and emphasize knowledge‐sharing barriers. The project managers put primary emphasis on project setting barriers, while the primary concern of developers, testers and user representatives were project communication, project organization and team capabilities barriers, respectively. Integrating the four causal maps and the agile literature, we propose a conceptual framework with seven types of knowledge‐sharing barriers and 37 specific barriers. We argue that to bridge communication gaps and create shared understanding in software teams, it is critical to take the revealed concerns of different roles into account. We conclude by discussing our findings in relation to knowledge sharing in agile teams and software teams more generally.},

Early research in electronic markets seemed to suggest that e‐ commerce transactions would result in decreased costs for buyers and sellers alike, and would therefore ultimately lead to the elimination of intermediaries from electronic value chains. However, a careful analysis of the structure and functions of electronic marketplaces reveals a different picture. Intermediaries provide many value‐adding functions that cannot be easily substituted or ‘internalized’ through direct supplier–buyer dealings, and hence mediating parties may continue to play a significant role in the e‐commerce world. In this paper we provide an analysis of the potential roles of intermediaries in electronic markets and we articulate a number of hypotheses for the future of intermediation in such markets. Three main scenarios are discussed: the disintermediation scenario, in which market dynamics will favour direct buyer–seller transactions; the reintermediation scenario, in which traditional intermediaries will be forced to differentiate themselves and re‐emerge in the electronic marketplace; and the cybermediation scenario, in which wholly new markets for intermediaries will be created. The analysis suggests that the likelihood of each scenario dominating a given market is primarily dependent on the exact functions that intermediaries play in each case. A detailed discussion of such functions is presented in the paper, together with an analysis of likely outcomes in the form of a contingency model for intermediation in electronic markets.},

While the current research discourse mainly follows conceptual perspectives, there has been little research on the practical implications on service agents' enabling co‐creation of value in the information technology (IT)‐supported service encounters with clients. In this paper, we seek to bridge this gap and first use the example of IT‐supported citizen advisory services to show the fundamental deficiencies in current service agents regarding the implementation of value co‐creation work practices. We introduce the concept of service encounter thinklets, adapted from collaboration engineering, to overcome these deficiencies and to empower service agents to put value co‐creation into practice. We show how service encounter thinklets can complement existing advisory support measures to enable service agents to transform the IT‐supported customer service encounter into a collaborative work environment, bringing together themselves, customers and supporting information systems to co‐create the advisory's value. A test with employees in a public administration's front office has provided first evidence that service encounter thinklets can effectively empower service agents on the job to adapt their work practices and to bring value co‐creation into practice.},

This theory is grounded on a 12‐month action design research study at one of the largest global software companies (here called Alpha) with mixed PaaS experiences in the past. Our primary research contribution is a set of design principles that guide software providers to define a viable PaaS business model in order to create a flourishing software ecosystem for their cloud platform.

Information systems researchers have differing views on this, some emphasizing the strengths of the generic and others the importance of contextual aspects. Contributing to this debate, Pollock and Williams have coined the term generification in order to describe how large vendors succeed in globalizing software packages through management by community, content and social authority. In this paper, we explore an approach that we call open generification , which extends Pollock and Williams' work in the sense that we acknowledge the need for and the feasibility of generic software, but propose an alternative model for the governance of it. Open generification is not about managing the community of users attached to a software package by homogenization or segmentation but aims at addressing the diverse needs of the community the software is expected to serve. Our empirical basis is a longitudinal study of the development of an open‐source health information system software (District Health Information software version 2), which is being used in more than 47 countries. Its success is attributed to a continuous interplay between generic and specific software and continuous cycles of embedding (implementing the global in the local context) and disembedding (taking local innovations into the global). We identify and discuss the contingent mechanisms of this interplay.},

One such paradigm seeks to complement or replace third‐party crowdfunding websites by embedding crowdfunding technologies directly into fund seekers' personal websites. This promises more control and customisation for fund seekers yet also distances fund‐seeking activities from the established crowds on websites such as Kickstarter and Indiegogo. Consequently, fund seekers adopting this paradigm must be capable of gathering and sustaining a suitable crowd that does not already exist in any one location. However, not all organisations are likely to possess the social resources to meet this challenge. Of those that do, little is known about how they might leverage these resources or the manner in which specific resources have an impact. Thus, the objective of this study is to explore the social resources that enable self‐hosted crowdfunding activities. In particular, this research models these activities by leveraging 2 a priori theoretical lenses: activity theory and social capital theory. These are applied to analyse an extreme case of self‐hosted crowdfunding, the funding of Star Citizen. Observations from this case are used to develop a propositional model that links different types of social capital with specific elements of self‐hosted crowdfunding.},

In contrast to a web site, for example, where a user interacts with a two‐dimensional site, virtual worlds provide a platform in which users can interact with other individuals, sometimes including strangers, within three‐dimensional environments. Virtual worlds afford a form of ‘socialness’ unlike many other technologies, often motivating a user – by virtue of these social experiences – to return. Drawing on the Spatial Model of Interaction and Awareness‐Attention Theory, we demonstrate that besides social aspects, which include social awareness and social perception, flow experience, which is the mental state of being fully absorbed and somewhat lost in time, is an essential ingredient in an individual's decision to return to a virtual world. We also demonstrate how characteristics of the technology are linked to the social aspects experienced in virtual worlds. A laboratory study conducted in a virtual world, Second Life, supports our assertions and identifies state predictors of flow that influence individuals' intentions to return to the virtual world environment.},

These findings are used to identify systems development approach, which extends understanding of the information systems development process beyond the levels of methodology and technical expertise. The term approach expresses the rich, varied, and complex ways in which professionals deal with development situations. The term transcends methodological components – which can be combined, tailored, or omitted altogether. Within approach, a framework for method choice, a key diagnostic scheme, and the use of a central repository reveal the significant background activity that goes into developing information systems. It is suggested that the information systems development process ultimately involves a professional using an approach to intervene in a problematic situation for developing the organization's information and, if needed, other systems. This understanding has implications for examining the field's ineffectiveness in relation to the approach adopted – rather than the methodology used.},

Against this backdrop, this paper explores the subalternity theory approach – developed by the Subaltern Studies collective from the early 1980s – as an indigenous theory that, proposing a socially and geographically connotated narration of ‘history from below’, can play a major role in the effort to decolonise critical IS research. By positioning subaltern theory in the IS field, the paper offers an alternative to the Western hegemony of critical theories, exploring the potential of such an alternative to voice systematically silenced and marginalised perspectives.},

In this paper, we develop a conceptual framework of Company Information Privacy Orientation that attempts to reconcile the differences between the organisation's information management objectives and its ethical and legal obligations to address customers' privacy. Control theory and justice theory are utilised to build an organisation‐level framework that is composed of a firm's ethical obligation to its customers, its customer information management strategy and its assessment of the risks to its business created by legal demands to provide customer information privacy. The four different types of company privacy orientation profiles that emerge from this conceptual framework are then discussed, along with implications for future research.},

This article argues that one way of understanding the role of technical developments in computers is to consider them as solutions looking for problems, rather than as solutions to pre‐existing problems. This reversal of popular opinion is premised on an analysis of the way that boundaries are drawn around the domain of the ‘technical’ such that computer users can be kept at a distance and their interpretation of computer user problems ‘managed’ more or less successfully by those purporting to resolve such problems. The result is that users are faced with a labour of Sisyphus: just when they thought they had resolved their problems another technical ‘advance’ suddenly appears and generates another problem. An awareness of the social framework for such developments may facilitate a clearer appreciation of the role of the problem solver in the construction of the problem itself.},

This study explores an often‐used concept in strategic management called ‘strategic orientation’ and applies it to internet‐based businesses. Based on an analysis of over 100 public businesses, firms that cluster together with similar strategic orientation are observed. These strategic groups are then analysed for performance differences. The results are discussed with the intent of learning from the dot‐burn effects as we evolve to the next generation of internet‐based business.},

We tested our multitheoretical model using Smart PLS 3.2.7 on a proprietary data set of 322 professionals in more than 14 branches throughout different regions worldwide. Our study contributes to the literature on information security, management, and leadership by exploring how and why different leadership styles enhance employees' intended information security behaviour. Our empirical findings emphasize the importance of transformational leaders because they are capable of directly influencing employees on the extra‐role and in‐role behaviour levels.

Thus, the online forum may be seen as an omniopticon in which the anonymous online self is monitored and disciplined in multiple ways.

Having been drawn on the social information processing theory, this research develops an integrative model that investigates how ethical work climate, beliefs, and neutralization interact to jointly explain ISP noncompliance. The model is tested via a survey of a broad cross section of employees. Neutralization, perceived cost of compliance, and perceived cost of noncompliance are found to significantly impact ISP noncompliance. Egoistic, benevolent, and principled climates are found to differentially influence neutralization and individuals' cognitive beliefs about the cost and benefit of ISP compliance versus noncompliance. Neutralization appears to be a more important moderator of the belief‐noncompliance relationship than the principled climate.},

This reveals that, while the relationship of attention, perception, movement and technology was a key element of the surprise, these themes are not well accounted for in current IS literature. In response, we employ J. J. Gibson's ecological theory of visual perception to reinterpret the empirical account and thereby build a new understanding of the human plus mobile technology that we term moving‐with‐technology . We introduce to IS: moving‐with‐technology as a new analytical perspective; the new phenomena of digital sub‐species , digital‐niches and asynchronous co‐location ; and stimulus for new ecologically oriented ‘mobile methods’. Moving‐with‐technology also has practical implications for urban planners who are using data from digital trace‐making tools such as Strava in their decision‐making, thereby generating what we call ecological feedback loops .},

This paper examines the capacity of the research designs of 37 empirical studies of information systems (IS) effectiveness to provide a basis for the development of theories about behaviour related to IS effectiveness. The power of each study to support causal inference was evaluated in terms of (a) its handling of the time dimension, (b) its ability to weigh differences and (c) its resistance to internal validity threats that pose alternative explanations for its reported findings. Of the reviewed studies, 29.7% could account for the time dimension, 32.4% employed a comparison group and 16.2% were not susceptible to any internal validity threats. Only 13.5% of the studies combined an accounting for the time dimension with the use of a comparison group. Of these, however, only 5.4% were also invulnerable to internal validity threats. The research designs of nearly 95% of these published studies were deficient in supporting causal inference. In those studies, suggestions that one variable was causally related to another variable could not be substantiated. Encouragement for the future capacity of IS effectiveness research to support causal inference was found in a trend towards the use of quasiexperimental designs. Recommendations are made regarding ways to increase the inferential capacity of research designs employed in the study of IS effectiveness.},

We respond to this long‐standing question by conceptualising ICT‐enabled national development as a multi‐level social process and by drawing on empirical findings from a natural experiment set in the context of health information system projects in Indonesia. Our study demonstrates that successful ICT‐enabled national development is not contingent on pursuing one strategy or the other but on how micro‐level actors interpret, and subsequently respond to, these strategies and the local changes they trigger. Our findings indicate that centralisation and decentralisation are complementary rather than competing strategies to ICT‐enabled national development because, if integrated into a hybrid strategy, decentralisation enables local communities to achieve national development outcomes commonly attributed to centralisation. As such, our work provides empirical evidence, explanations and new theoretical insight into the wider ‘centralisation versus decentralisation’ debate, while also outlining avenues for future research and guidelines for policymakers.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. Integrated information systems and operational efficiency are both pivotal issues for contemporary firms. While there is substantial evidence that enterprise resources planning (ERP) systems can deliver related improvements, the implementation of these systems can turn out to be a very complex and risky task. One key aspect of managing these risks is maintaining operational momentum and preventing possible problems from escalating in the so‐called shakedown phase shortly after system implementation. The objective of this paper is to examine how user evaluations of ERP system success could be used to trace down the source of potential problems, which can arise during the shakedown phase, and how and why experienced system success might vary between different user groups. The paper builds on a case study completed in the after‐sales division of a large multinational organization. This context is considered a fruitful empirical setting for the study as the business sets enormous demands for ERP system functionality and its smooth implementation. Based on the case study, it is argued that in such a context the importance of sufficient user skills, data reliability and intra‐organizational communication becomes emphasized in the ERP implementation process. Moreover, results illustrate how downstream operations and customer relations are particularly vulnerable to problems accumulated in upstream business processes. Related problems can potentially form a self‐fulfilling cycle, where the lack of skills and information constantly deteriorates both user perceptions and actual operational performance.},

It uses four conceptual frameworks in this respect – core competencies, transaction cost economics, agency theory and partnership – in an empirical comparison of IT outsourcing in the public and private sectors within the UK. The qualitative research methodology involved interviews with IT managers in both sectors and documentary analysis of outsourcing vendors’ literature. The findings suggest that practices and perceptions of IT outsourcing found in the two sectors support the basic principles of some frameworks more than others, e.g. core competencies, transaction cost economics and agency theory are well developed with partnerships less so. However, using all four frameworks improves understanding of multifaceted strategic practice in fundamentally different types of organization and helps to expose some issues which have not emerged in previous outsourcing studies.},

These supporting IS provide an alternative path to corporate sustainability rather than just contributing to the ‘greening’ of business practices by aiming to improve the organizational performance impact of environmental advantageous innovations, which in turn fosters their adoption. Employing a multiple case study comprising eight companies that have implemented such eco‐innovations (specifically electric vehicles) in their business processes, our findings indicate that the organizational performance contribution of eco‐innovations is improved when complemented by supporting IS. This effect is achieved by (1) enhancing the efficiency of the business processes in which the eco‐innovations are deployed, thus increasing eco‐efficiency, and (2) enabling new functionalities, processes and business models that help achieve organizational sustainability goals, thereby driving eco‐effectiveness. With these two aspects, we add two functional affordances – technological flexibility and digital eco‐innovation – to the existing knowledge base of Green IS and point to an elaborated role of IS in sustainability transformation.},

Telemedicine is a particular mode of informed collaboration—information and communications technology–supported collaborative activity in which collaborators rely (wholly or in part) on digitally stored information retrieved from various sources to pursue their collective objectives. We report on an embedded‐cases study of a long‐running geriatric telepsychiatry clinic in the north‐eastern United States. Our analysis draws on the theory of distributed cognition (DCog) to explicate the ways in which information and cognitive effort are distributed across individuals and artefacts to support psychiatric consultation from a distance and how these processes play out over time in routines. On the basis of this case study, we offer a refinement of DCog theory, focusing on four interrelated dynamic processes that, we propose, act as critical enablers of informed collaboration: cognitive offloading, visibility of action, intersubjective understanding, and knowledge redundancy. We discuss practical implications for designing telemedicine services and tools, and we offer suggestions for further research on informed collaboration.},

Given the growing use of these systems as end‐user training (EUT) aids, there is a need for greater understanding of how participants use these systems, as well as whether participant‐controlled learning environments are truly effective. The present research examines how a particular learner characteristic, software self‐efficacy, drives appropriation in a high learner control, CSSTS environment. Contrary to notions in the literature, results from spreadsheet and database software training courses reveal that pre‐training specific software self‐efficacy constitutes a significant, negative predictor of faithful appropriations of the CSSTS. This research also establishes a positive relationship between faithful appropriation and increases in software self‐efficacy (SSE). In essence, faithful appropriations lead to greater increases in SSE, which influences software skills performance. In addition, the research validates prior EUT research by extending prior findings to a database training environment. A psychometrically sound measure is put forth to capture database self‐efficacy.},

In doing so, the paper takes a novel perspective by going beyond the dominant emphasis in the Green IS literature on climate change mitigation to focus on climate change adaptation. To demonstrate how IS researchers and practitioners can engage with the grand challenge of sustainability, we report the findings of an investigation into the role of IS in climate change adaptation programmes of the government of New South Wales, Australia. Canonical action research, informed by activity theory, proved to be an appropriate methodology for this investigation by combining iterative collaborative engagement and rigorous scholarly reflection. Activity theory has previously been successfully used in IS research as a framework for inquiry and description but not for prediction. This raised questions, addressed in this study, about whether or not activity theory could be used to guide interventions and make sense of their impact. The findings reveal how activity theory provides an appropriate balance between scope and detail to accommodate the complex processes of planning and implementing climate change adaptation programmes. We conclude that while climate adaptation is complex, activity theory, specifically five dynamic dimensions for deep sense‐making, can inform interventions in climate change adaptation projects. Most significantly, we demonstrate that IS experts can make a positive contribution to addressing one of the most important grand challenges of our time.},

Based on an integrative synthesis of the literature, we present a map of the most significant ISD research, uncover gaps in its canons and suggest fruitful lines of inquiry for new research. Our review combines citation analysis, which identifies the field's evidence of cumulative tradition, with computer‐aided textual analysis, a hermeneutically guided method that organizes the fragmented corpus of ISD literature into coherent knowledge areas. From a pool of over 6500 articles published in the IS Senior Scholars' Basket of Journals, we find 940 IS citation classics, and from that list, 466 ISD articles that offer canonical ISD knowledge distinctive to IS and complementary to other disciplines such as software engineering and project management. From this study, we offer two contributions: (1) a justification for an ISDBOK grounded in the theory of practice and professionalism, and (2) a canonical map of disciplinary ISD knowledge with areas that have demonstrated cumulative tradition and others that require the attention of IS scholars. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Knowledge management is the computer’s contribution to management ‘science’ and claims to be the successor of various trends in the business world, including, but not necessarily limited to information resources management, business process reengineering, management information systems and organizational memory. A number of definitions have been proposed for it. The very concept of knowledge used by knowledge management writers, however, is based on a dubious epistemology. This paper looks at the concept of knowledge from a continental perspective. With this perspective, we question whether what is being managed is, in fact, knowledge, and whether management will get business what it wants anyway.},

We present the case study of an adult study‐circle project in the Kwale County of Kenya with the objective of providing rural communities with viable and sustainable livelihoods. Study circles can be seen as a democratic and emancipatory method for learning, where community groups regularly meet for participatory discussions to educate themselves on a variety of topics of their own interest. The main goal of the study‐circle members was to increase economic opportunities using ICT and, more specifically, to start micro‐businesses, improve production efficacy and methods, and obtain employment. Using the capability approach and affordances as theoretical lenses, our analysis of the explorative case study shows that the outcomes of the study circle were dependent on various conversion factors and facilitating conditions, such as resources, skills, socio‐cultural norms, and infrastructure. The main contributions from our work are represented by the five practical lessons learned from the study‐circle members' goals (starting micro‐businesses, product efficiency, and obtaining employment) from the self‐organised training approach (study circles) and from our theoretical approach (combining the capability approach and affordances).},

The factors affecting knowledge diffusion through social media networks (SMNs) need to therefore be better understood. Accordingly, this paper focuses on two SMN‐specific characteristics – reputation mechanisms and the distribution of knowledge roles – which are argued to enhance and enable, respectively, the smooth transfer of knowledge in a SMN. To examine their effects, we distinguish between two types of reputation mechanisms – adaptive and objective – and across three distinct knowledge roles in SMNs: seekers, contributors and brokers. We argue that the extent of knowledge diffusion in the SMN depends on the type of mechanism and the relative distribution of these three roles. Using data collected through an agent‐based simulation, we find that (a) the distribution of knowledge roles affects knowledge diffusion, with distributions consisted of more brokers outperforming others and (b) objective reputation mechanisms outperform adaptive mechanisms. Furthermore, we find that reputation mechanisms and distribution of knowledge roles interact to influence knowledge diffusion. The study's implications for future research and practice are discussed in the light of its limitations. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

While ERP aims at integrating functional‐area information systems within a company into a coherent, enterprise‐wide, and web‐enabled network, its implementation is especially challenging to enterprises in China because of high implementation costs, technical complexity, lack of information technology infrastructure, lack of well‐trained employees, lack of incentives to state‐owned enterprises, and a corporate culture different from that in the West. A RBP of a firm, however, posits that firms should compete on the basis of unique corporate resources that are valuable, rare, difficult to imitate, and unsubstitutable. Thus, this research assesses major ERP challenges in China based upon a three‐tier decision process in pursuit of a sustainable competitive advantage. This RBP model is then embedded with data from a survey research to illustrate potential applications and managerial implications.},

In this study, we investigate how the use of ubiquitous consumer technology evolves over time and suggest a theoretical account of how use evolves into different patterns of embodiment. Empirically, we followed 15 consumers of smartphones during a 6‐month field study and collected data via interviews, survey, and focus groups. Analytically, we view the user as a consumer of technology and develop three technology life narratives as patterns of embodiment. As a theoretical lens, we draw upon the theory of consumption values and approached use as a dynamic consumption process in which different values drive use over time. We found three distinct patterns of embodiment: that of conditionalists, aesthetic socialites, and functional enthusiasts. Conditionalists are pragmatic and use technology only when the device fulfils pre‐existing needs and the preferred alternative is unavailable. Aesthetic socialites use the technology as a fashion accessory and to manage their personal relationships. Functional enthusiasts are gadget lovers whose tinkering for the sake of exploration leads them to discover new needs that the technology can fulfil. Besides the three patterns of embodiment, we discovered a type of use that we argue falls outside of the values described in the theory of consumption values. This is the use of technology without any identifiable purpose other than just using the technology, which is driven by expositional value.},

Using the Nordic bank Nordea as a case study and a Green information systems (IS) organizational response model developed on the basis of extant literature, we investigate how Green IS initiatives become part of a firm's overall strategy and part of the organizational sustainability process. We find that Green IS initiatives are initiated through a bottom‐up process where environmentally concerned individuals identify issues and become Green IS champions. They use their authority and edification skills to promote Green IS to the organizational agenda. If the issue is aligned with the organizational agenda, it receives management's endorsement. The empirical case also shows two types of systemic feedback that can fuel a self‐reinforcing sustainability process. The first type of feedback increases the champion's ability to promote Green IS in the future through authority and edification. The second type leads to the transformation of organizational value through reinforcement and extension. Finally, we identify interrelationships between organizational response processes, where higher‐order response processes, e.g. change of corporate values, function as gatekeepers or pre‐conditions for when and which issues are promoted to the organizational agenda. © 2016 Wiley Publishing Ltd},

   abstract                      = {One of the key competitive advantages of sharing economy platforms stems from their superior IT capabilities, which enable operations that are more efficient and/or effective than the incumbent firms. However, given that many of the incumbents tend to be established market leaders or resource‐rich multi‐nationals, their general inability to acquire the appropriate digital options (ie, the IT capabilities that enable the launch of, and response to, competitive actions) to meet the challenge of the sharing economy platforms is puzzling. This study explores this phenomenon by posing the research question: How do the “forces at work” associated with the sharing economy paradigm impact the digital options of incumbent firms? Based on the case of Qiangsheng Taxi and how its IT capabilities have been affected by the emergence of ridesharing platforms, the evidence uncovered suggests that the sharing economy can influence the digital options of incumbent firms through a process of digital attrition, which may be induced by a blend of unfavorable contextual influences (ie, an unbalanced regulatory regime, evolving market preferences and the resourcing advantages of sharing economy platforms). A framework is inductively derived from the data collected that depicts digital attrition as a process of three phases: (a) deinstitutionalization, (b) technological incapacitation, and (c) competitive erosion. In doing so, our study suggests that digital attrition may culminate in IT‐induced competitive disadvantages for incumbent firms, which in turn, could exacerbate the unfavorable contextual influences to complete a vicious cycle that reinforces the negative influence of the sharing economy even further.},

Application of the resilience framework was undertaken through interviews and a survey in an urban community in Costa Rica; benchmarking both community resilience and “e‐resilience” (understood here as the contribution of ICTs to community resilience), and developing from these a set of action priorities. The paper reflects on what can be learned generally from this conceptualisation and operationalisation of resilience. It also reflects on what ICTs contribute to resilience in developing countries and on what this ICT4D‐based research specifically contributes to the identified IS knowledge gaps. This includes identification of a future research agenda on information systems and resilience.},

Our results explicate the prospects of distinguishing privacy risk dimensions by demonstrating how they are differently pronounced across contexts and how technology designs can be tailored to assuage them. Thus, our findings improve the understanding of context and service‐specific privacy risks, helping managers to adjust their digital offerings to mitigate users' privacy risk perceptions.},

   abstract                      = {The failure rate of fintech platforms is disproportionately high, which may be because (1) there is a lack of published knowledge on the appropriate strategies to adopt and/or (2) the traditional prescriptions for strategy may be less relevant in the context of fintech platforms. To ascertain either or both of these possibilities, we conducted a comprehensive review of the fintech literature and found that not only is there a relative paucity of research on Fintech Strategies, but there are also important limitations associated with the existing works. To address these limitations, we first identified the unique characteristics of fintech platforms and the strategic implications of those characteristics. Next, we adapted a framework made up of six conventional core logics of strategy and juxtaposed the prescriptions of those logics with the unique characteristics identified. Finally, we constructed a research agenda consisting of a number of open questions based on our analysis to provide directions for future research in this area. The agenda suggests that fintech platform strategies have to account for competing institutional logics stemming from the platforms' dual identity and the tensions between conforming for legitimacy and differentiating for competitive advantage. There is also a need to account for an exceptionally dynamic and unpredictable regulatory landscape, as well as the responses and competitive actions of influential market incumbents.},

We examine the use of metaphors by project team members, including representatives of the users, software developers and the managers guiding the project work. The findings indicate that project team members and managers use a rich set of metaphors to make sense of the project and the records management system they are working on. Notably, distinct sets of metaphors are used in different project phases and among the project personnel and management. As the differences in the metaphors also coincide with key events in the trajectory of the project, we contend that metaphors have significant power in sensemaking, influencing action and project outcomes. In particular, we find that in highly ambiguous, knowledge‐intensive situations, metaphor use with unclear intentions and purpose hinders learning and creates more chaos than order. From a practical perspective, our study highlights the relevance of metaphor use for project management. We suggest that intentional selection of metaphors by management could be beneficial for many complex information systems projects. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

However, so far, marginal attention has been paid to differences in user involvement practices between information systems. This paper explores user involvement in developing mobile and temporarily interconnected systems (MTIS). We refer to MTIS as heterogeneous systems that rely on network technologies for increasing the ubiquity of information services for users on the move. Such systems are becoming increasingly important in leveraging, e.g. car infotainment, supply chain management and wireless e‐commerce. With particular emphasis on the nature of MTIS and its implications for user involvement, the paper analyses the systems development process of an action research project. The findings suggest that user involvement practices need to be adapted to accommodate features of this class of systems. Being an early attempt to trace the implications of technology features such as use context switches and temporary system relationships, the paper contributes to the development of an updated theory of the user role in an era of increased system complexity and stakeholder ambiguity.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. Communication plays a crucial role in influencing our social life. However, communication has often been distorted by unequal opportunities to initiate and participate in it. Such conditions have been criticized by Habermas who argues for an ideal speech situation, i.e. a situation of democratic communication with equal opportunities for social actors to communicate in an undistorted manner. This ideal situation is partially being realized by the advent of the internet. The paper describes how an internet‐based tool for collaborative authoring was conceptualized, developed and then deployed with Habermas's Critical Social Theory as a guiding principle. The internet‐based electronic forum, known by its acronym GRASS (Group Report Authoring Support System), is a web tool supporting the production of concise group reports that give their readers an up‐to‐date and credible overview of the positions of various stakeholders on a particular issue. Together with people and procedures, it is a comprehensive socio‐technical information system that can play a role in resolving societal conflicts. A prototype of GRASS has been used by an environmental group as a new way in which to create a more equal exchange and comparison of ideas among various stakeholders in the debate on genetically modified food. With the widespread use of the internet, such a forum has the potential to become an emergent form of communication for widely dispersed social actors to conduct constructive debate and discussion. The barriers to such a mode of communication still remain – in the form of entrenched power structures, and limitations to human rationality and responsibility. However, we believe that the support provided by the comprehensive system of technological functionality as well as procedural checks and balances provided by GRASS may considerably reduce the impact of these obstacles. In this way, the ideal speech situation may be approximated more closely in reality.},

Our results show that user intention to adopt an email security service is contingent upon users' perception of risk and evaluation of both internal and external coping strategies.

On the other hand, neither offers a sufficiently general‐purpose formal model of negotiation that could serve as a backbone for NSS research. A survey of that research is provided, indicating that prugress to date has been somewhat eclectic and devoid of such a model. Our central contention is that a theoretical foundation for NSS study is much needed.

   abstract                      = {Abstract. The Internet presents a unique environment in which to study adoption. This is because of its composition of autonomous entities that are otherwise strongly interrelated. Our model of Internet standards adoption (ISA) combines diffusion of innovation and economics of adoption literature to present an integrative model. This model proposes that the adoption of Internet‐based standards is dependent upon two dimensions: the usefulness of the features to the potential adopter, and the conduciveness of the environment to adoption of the standard. This model accounts for not only the traditional dichotomous view of adoption, but also includes the notion of ‘partial adoption’, where both old and new standards can coexist for extended periods of time. As a demonstration, we apply the ISA model to the next generation Internet protocol Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). Despite its ostensible superiority, IPv6 has not been widely adopted. In this paper we discuss the reasons why this might be the case. Our analysis also draws wider conclusions about the adoption of Internet standards: in particular, the importance of transitional technologies between the old and new standards and the need for co‐ordinated government polices which encourage adoption. Our analysis also indicates that geopolitical boundaries may have a considerable impact on the adoption of Internet standards.},

Whereas explanation based on the statistical relationship between independent and dependent variables is a common outcome of explanatory IS research, philosophers of science disagree about whether statistical relationships are the sole basis for the explanation of phenomena. The purpose of this paper is to introduce an expanded concept of explanation into the realm of IS research. We present a framework based on the four principle explanation types defined in modern philosophy: covering‐law explanation, statistical‐relevance explanation, contrast‐class explanation and functional explanation. A well‐established research stream, media richness, is used to illustrate how the different explanation types complement each other in increasing comprehension of the phenomenon. This framework underlies our argument that explanatory pluralism can be used to broaden research perspectives and increase scientific comprehension of IS phenomena above and beyond the methodological and ontological pluralism currently in use in IS research.},

The pilot research described here uses the MIT 1990s framework (Scott‐Morton, 1991) as the underpinning theory to challenge the dominant approach to the management of strategic change. The preliminary findings provide new insights into how strategic change is pursued and offer a new perspective from which the propositions suggested by Scott‐Morton (1991) and Yetton et al. (1994) can be reformulated. Four change patterns (archetypes) are identified that describe planned or emergent modes of change, driven by different change elements under various circumstances. These findings lead to a redesign of the M/T 1990s framework and suggest new ways of understanding how strategic change can be sustained. Further research is required to explore the link between the archetypes identified and the various methods of change.},

The proposed model was tested empirically using survey data collected from five telecommunication companies. The findings reveal that interpersonal trust has a positive effect on knowledge sharing, while uncertainty has a negative effect upon knowledge sharing. The results also show that social interaction ties and shared knowledge‐sharing vision are the antecedent factors of interpersonal trust, and that uncertainty regarding knowledge sharing is increased by seeker absorptive capability concerns, reciprocity concerns and fear of losing knowledge power. Some important implications for theory and practice as well as directions for future study are discussed.},

Specifically, we propose that three dimensions of social capital (i.e., cognitive, structural and relational capital) contribute positively to the two types of online buyers' satisfaction (i.e., economic and social satisfaction). In addition, we posit that perceived effectiveness of e‐commerce institutional mechanisms (PEEIM) moderates the relationships between economic and social satisfaction and buyers' loyalty to the platform. Three hundred buyers on the Consumer‐to‐Consumer platform, TaoBao, were surveyed to test the proposed model. The results suggest that buyers' evaluation of social capital with the community of sellers can enhance their satisfaction with the sellers, which subsequently affect their loyalty to the platform. Furthermore, perceived effectiveness of e‐commerce institutional mechanisms negatively moderates the effect of economic satisfaction and positively moderates the effect of social satisfaction on buyers' loyalty to the platform. The theoretical contributions and practical implications are discussed.},

These developments have given rise to novel types of service and smart service systems (SSS), ie, resource configurations capable of learning, dynamic adaptation, and decision making. Currently, the internet of things (IoT) is turning physical objects into active smart things, bridging the gap between the physical and the digital world. Smart things advance SSS as they observe the physical environment, access local data, immerse into individuals' everyday lives and organizational routines. In line with the emergent nature of both phenomena, the impact of the IoT on SSS yet needs to be explored. Building the basis for explanatory and design‐led research and for the analysis and design of SSS, a means for the conceptual modelling of SSS that accounts for novel IoT‐enabled concepts is in high need. Hence, we designed, demonstrated, and evaluated a domain‐specific modelling language (DSML) for SSS. We evaluated the DSML by using it in the modelling of real‐world scenarios from all functional IoT domains, by submitting it to the scrutiny of industry experts, by discussing it against generic DSML requirements, and by analysing to what extent it meets domain‐specific design objectives compared with competing artefacts. To demonstrate the DSML, we included a complex real‐world scenario centred around the Nest Learning Thermostat.},

Prior researchers have reported that software prototypes can be used to help bridge knowledge boundaries between team members in traditional software development settings, yet their use in an agile development setting remains unexplored. Agile development centers the interactions between team members on emerging representations of the prototype whose properties are prone to change over time. Therefore, we conducted an in‐depth study of an agile development project to enhance our understanding on how software prototypes are used as boundary objects in a distributed team setting. Our analyses of team member interactions during 46 virtual meetings that took place over a period of 6 months revealed four different prototype use practices (exemplifying, contrasting, relating, framing) that were effective in bridging syntactic, semantic, or pragmatic knowledge boundaries. We also provide empirically grounded evidence of how variations in object properties can afford different use practices, how the use practices take advantage of these properties, and how object properties are reshaped through these use practices as different types of knowledge boundaries are bridged. These findings bear important implications for research on prototypes as boundary objects in software development in particular and boundary object use in general.},

Although these recommendations for how IS management should be taught remain valid, they need to be updated to account for recent advances in technologies that enable multimedia learning. Promoters of such technologies promise enhanced cognitive and behavioural outcomes, but this promise remains unreached, reflecting the underdeveloped multimedia‐enabled learning literature. To help attain this promise and rejuvenate the literature of multimedia learning, we offer a roadmap for new areas of research that would inform the design and use of a novel form of multimedia materials: narrative animated videos (NAVs). NAVs represent a form of self‐determined learning that features immersive, story‐based content. We argue that their use will intrinsically motivate users to process the materials to completion, thereby enhancing cognitive and behavioural outcomes, and thus catalysing the effectiveness of the team‐based learning and self‐regulated learning modes for problem‐based learning (PBL) delivery of IS management education. This compelling roadmap corresponds to meaningful IS research because it centres on a topic that the IS literature has long examined—the role of user motivation—and because its theoretical contributions invite specific paths of research for informing the design of the PBL delivery of IS management education within an information systems artefact.},

In the light of the objectives of a specific research project, various techniques are considered. Analysis of the techniques in relation to specific research project objectives leads to the adoption of a form of Kelly's RepGrid technique for the specific project described here. A detailed description is included about how RepGrids were applied in this instance. It is shown that RepGrids are appropriate for gathering qualitative interview data. The technique provides structure to a ‘one‐to‐one’ interview. But, at the same time, RepGrids allow sufficient flexibility for the research participants to be able to express their own interpretation about a particular topic. Further, because the content of the data is determined by the research participant researcher bias is reduced. The article concludes by suggesting that the RepGrid technique supports the generation of rich in‐depth data and is a reliable research technique for gathering qualitative data about information systems analysts.},

The need for compatible standards and procedures within these international networks means that the systems analyst will play a key role in this globalization process. It is, therefore, considered timely that there is a developing body of research into the effects of cultural differences on the design and development of IS. This article reports research into the way in which ‘excellent’ systems analysts are perceived in Canada and Singapore. The research method adopted the RepGrid technique from Kelly's Theory of Personal Constructs, which served as the vehicle to facilitate the elicitation of participant comments. Seventeen interviews were conducted in Singapore compared with 53 in Canada. The results suggest that, in terms of the overall approach and priorities that systems analysts place on their work, there is evidence of a commonality, which unites the profession in these two countries. This may be evidence of convergence, which occurs as the result of common education, training and socialization of new entrants into the international occupational community of systems analysts. However, there is also strong evidence of divergence between these two countries based on the different emphasis on the way in which systems analysts will play their roles in each country. As a reflection of the culture of each society, the Singaporean systems analysts are more likely to rely on expertise to influence clients, whereas the Canadian systems analysts rely more on encouraging the client to participate in the design effort.},

We report from our design and evaluation process and present our final artefact, the teaching framework. The aim is to educate reflective practitioners with multiple ES skills, enabling them to tackle the complexities of ES implementation contexts. The framework has implications for IS educational research and practice and has some generic values that are transferable to other academic institutions and adaptable to other IS learning environments. Further, the study contributes to IS design research by extending its application area. The ES teaching framework is a specific contribution to IS teaching frameworks as a class of problems.},

In this paper, we describe an example of an IOS developed as part of a strong inter‐firm relationship. In 1999, Vodafone of the UK embarked on a transformation to globalize its relationship with Ericsson of Sweden, moving from a set of in‐country relationships to a global relationship mediated through an IOS. As of 2002, the IOS is heavily used, and continues to evolve as part of the overall relationship. Vodafone and Ericsson pursued a journey‐oriented approach to globalization and development, freed from any formal project plan, and identified asymmetric benefits. Using a model previously developed by Gallivan & Depledge (2003), we explore the roles and dynamics of trust, planning and benefits. We posit that a journey or improvisational approach to IOS development works where a relationship is strong and levels of inter‐firm trust are high. We suggest that the nature of the inter‐firm relationship is more important than the approach to IOS development.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. One can expect that the fit, match or congruence between an information system and its organizational context will be of increasing importance as information systems become more and more integral parts of organizations. Existing IS research has largely neglected the theoretical analysis of the concept ‘fit’, however, even though it has been widely used in a ‘pre‐theoretical’ sense. The analysis of the concept of ‘organizational fit of an information system’ put forward in this article is essentially based on the recent analysis of ‘fit’ in contingency theory, suggesting three interpretations for the concept: a selection approach, an interaction approach and a systems approach. A review of the IS literature on the organizational fit of information systems indicates a lack of any cumulative tradition in existing empirical contingency research into information systems and dominance of the selection approach. Because of the two limitations, this paper regards any definite assessment of the potential prospects of contingency research into information systems as overhasty and proposes a framework for future research into the situation dependence and organizational fit of information systems which integrates contingency research into information systems, contingency research into IS impacts and contingency research into the IS adoption (development/implementation) process.},

(<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#isj12121-bib-0036"/>) suggest the concept of information system (IS) artefact as an alternative to information technology (IT) artefact, defining the former as a system of an IT artefact, an information artefact and a social artefact. This paper assesses this suggestion, contrasting it with the concepts of IT artefact and IS application as introduced in the prior IS literature. After this conceptual analysis, the paper discusses the relationships between an IS artefact and design and between an IS artefact and design science. The analysis concludes that an IS artefact is problematic as a unit of design because of the great differences in the designability of its constituent parts. Instead, the paper maintains that an IS application is more appropriate as a unit of design, but an IS artefact may be fruitful as an analytical concept to be used in behavioural science research on the interplay of IT artefact, information artefact and social artefact, or – especially if including IS application design – in action research‐oriented design science research. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. This paper introduces the idea of coding a practically relevant body of knowledge (BoK) in Information Systems (IS) that could have major benefits for the field. In its main part, the paper focuses on the question if and how an underlying body of action‐oriented knowledge for IS experts could be distilled from the IS research literature. For this purpose the paper identifies five knowledge areas as the most important parts for an IS expert's BoK. Two of these are claimed as distinct areas of competence for IS experts: IS application knowledge and IS development (ISD) process knowledge. The paper focuses particularly on ISD process knowledge because it allows the organizing of practically relevant IS knowledge in an action‐oriented way. The paper presents some evidence for the claim that a considerable body of practically relevant IS process knowledge might, indeed, exist, but also notes that it is highly dispersed in the IS literature. It then argues that the IS research community should take stock of this knowledge and organize it in an action‐oriented way. Based on results from prior work it proposes a four‐level hierarchical coding scheme for this purpose. In order to test the idea of coding action‐oriented knowledge for IS experts, the paper reports the results of a coded literature analysis of ISD research articles published from 1996 to 2000 in two leading IS journals – Information Systems Journal and MIS Quarterly. The results suggest that ISD approaches form a useful framework for organizing practically relevant IS knowledge.},

We have organized, together with children, digital technology projects that we now critically examine from the perspective of inclusion/exclusion. The paper shows that in social inclusion projects, there is exclusion taking place in a multitude of forms, shaped by a variety of rules and powers. We use nexus analysis as a theoretical and methodological tool that guides us to study inclusion/exclusion as processes, within which both discourses and concrete actions are to be acknowledged as well as historical and interactional aspects—both at individual level and at the level of social structures. Our study shows that inclusion and exclusion may be intentionally accomplished by children themselves, those may result without any intentional effort because of circumstances and those may also be done for children by various kinds of adults. Although children's empowerment and agency are significant, also adults play a decisive role. Implications for social inclusion and digital technology education research and practice are discussed. Nexus analysis is suggested as a useful means for revealing and managing the complexity involved in social inclusion/exclusion.},

With this in mind, the role that information systems play in supporting improvements in e‐government service delivery to stakeholder groups continues to attract much attention. The authors of this paper seek to define the scope and role that information systems evaluation plays within the public sector. In particular, the authors assess whether public sector organizations might benefit from the use of established ex‐ante evaluation techniques, when applied to analyse the impact of e‐government information systems. Following a comprehensive review of the normative literature, an initial conceptual framework for public sector information systems evaluation is proposed, which is then empirically explored within two local government authorities. The conceptual framework is then revised by using the structured case approach, which is dependent on an iterative research cycle where triangulated data are elicited. This then supports the emergence of new concepts during each research cycle that leads to the view that information systems evaluation in the public sector is a process of experiential and subjective judgement, which is grounded in opinion and world views. This leads the authors to challenge the appropriateness of traditional modes of investment appraisal when applied in the public sector. The finalized framework embraces investment decisions, evaluation methods, culture and structure, as well as post hoc evaluation. It emphasizes the importance of situated, interpretive user assessments in evaluating e‐government investments.},

The program measures key indicators of all completed projects and summarizes progress information in a quarterly management report. The implementation turns out to be long and complex, as the organization is confronted with dilemmas based on contradictory demands and value conflicts. The process is interpreted as a combination of a rational engineering process in which a metrics program is constructed and put into use, and an evolutionary cultivation process in which basic values of the software organization are confronted and transformed. The analysis exemplifies the difficulties and challenges that software organizations face when bringing known principles for software metrics programs into practical use. The article discusses the insights gained from the case in six lessons that may be used by Software Process Improvement managers in implementing a successful metrics program.},

Such an approach demands that we consider the strategic rationales involved in teamworking generally, and virtual teams in particular. By looking at change processes, attention is drawn to the social, cultural and political dynamics that affect the implementation and operation of virtual teams.

We take a more dynamic, situational and interactionist approach that proposes that security‐related behaviours result from an interaction between the person and the perception of a threatening situation. We derive and define situational information security awareness based on situation awareness literature, and examine how individual‐level (innate traits, experience) and system‐level factors (design variations, warning signal) influence awareness, and how it influences subsequent threat and coping appraisals, and ultimately security‐related behaviours in a multi‐method phishing experiment including eye tracking and survey components with 107 employees. The results underscore the importance of situational information security awareness and show that past experience with phishing and a security warning increase awareness, while phishing emails' contextual relevance and misplaced salience decrease awareness. Situational information security awareness, in turn, increases perceived threat and perceived coping efficacy and, ultimately, actual behavioural responses to phishing attacks.},

These technologies pair devices that have various embedded sensors with one or more apps to allow for the collection, analysis, socialization, and management of individuals' health and wellness data. We have limited insight into what drives the use of fitness technologies or how they may contribute to wellness outcomes. To address this gap, our study examines how exercise goals are related to fitness technology feature set use and how the use is associated with a measure of the exercisers' psychological well‐being (ie, subjective vitality). We find that intrinsic exercise goals (eg, enjoyment or competence) are associated with the use of features that allow users to collect, analyse, and inform their exercise progress. Body‐focused extrinsic exercise goals (eg, appearance) are also associated with the use of such features but are negatively associated with features that socialize exercise. The social extrinsic exercise goal is associated with the use of more controlling features that can provide external pressure from the technology or other people. The social features of fitness technologies are associated with higher levels of subjective vitality. Our findings indicate that exercisers who have goals where measuring progress may be desired (eg, losing weight and training for a marathon) are more likely to be drawn to the data management aspects of fitness technologies, whereas using fitness technologies to socialize exercise may add an element of enjoyment that is attractive to some users and may lead to increased well‐being.},

   abstract                      = {Reward‐based crowdfunding platforms – in which campaigns exchange rewards for financial backing to develop a product or service – are one of the fastest‐growing segments of the crowdfunding industry. We use an extension of social exchange theory (SET) called the resource theory of social exchange (RTSE) to examine resource exchanges through rewards on Kickstarter. A resource exchange occurs when a project backer and project creator exchange money (ie, financial backing) for a reward (eg, a thank you or a t‐shirt). A project creator can develop a reward portfolio that contains various types of resources, which in the RTSE are categorised as love, status, information, money, goods and services. Our study provides a comprehensive examination of resource exchange on a major reward‐based crowd funding platform, answering the call to investigate the effects of a key element of such platforms – rewards. We find that the types of resources project creators include in the reward portfolios they offer should be carefully considered. Specifically, our results indicate it is more beneficial to offer rewards that contain universal and concrete resources (eg, goods, services) than resources that are particularistic and symbolic (eg, love, status). However, the positive effect of offering universal and concrete resources as rewards is diminished as the fundraising goal is increased, which suggests that the optimal design of the reward portfolio is contingent on other characteristics of the campaign. Moreover, our findings reveal that while it is advantageous to offer more rewards, it is disadvantageous to offer too many different types of resources across those rewards. Overall, our study adds depth to the understanding of resource exchange in reward‐based crowdfunding and provides practical insight into how to design reward portfolios.},

This paper presents the findings of a longitudinal study of the Slovenian company Sava during its 1995–2004 transition period when it adapted to and prospered in a free market economy. The company is particularly interesting because of its successful transition from a socialist company operating in a protected market to a privatized company operating in a capitalist global market, as well as the pivotal role of information technology (IT)‐supported organizational learning that brought about radical change and successful transition. Our investigation of Sava’s experiences demonstrates how the company’s increasing attention to organizational learning, integration of working and learning, and its constant innovation of products and processes created new needs for IT support that motivated the adoption of new IT systems (such as Lotus Notes, document management systems, SAP), which in turn increased Sava’s capacity to learn. Furthermore, our study reveals how the role of IT systems in organizational learning depends on the nature of learning (single‐loop, double‐loop or triple‐loop learning) and the organizational level at which learning takes place (individual, group/department or organization). By providing insight into the emergence of distinct types of IT‐supported learning and their vital role in Sava’s successful transition, the paper contributes to a deeper understanding of the relationship between IT and organizational learning that is relevant and inspiring to other companies, especially those operating in transition economies.},

However, assigning speech acts to one of a few categories is not without controversy. The process is context dependent and, hence, individuals with divergent contextual views may categorize speech acts differently. Different categories, in turn, imply different speech act interpretations. The difficulty of disparate speech act interpretations can often be resolved by, for example, a process of negotiation. Nonetheless, it is easy to envisage situations in which agreement by negotiation is not possible. Such would be the case when a researcher studies transcribed speech act performances. We propose that Ballmer and Brennenstuhl's (1981) speech at classification method, which relies on an extensive speech act verb lexicon with sequencing and contextual information, can reduce disagreement among individuals who singly or together analyse and ascribe meaning to speech acts. We base this proposition on the results of exploratory research involving alternative knowledge acquisition methods. Our exploratory results suggest that Ballmer and Brennenstuhl's lexicon provides several promising future research directions of speech act use in information systems.},

This paper develops a knowledge transfer framework based on an empirical analysis of part of the UK operation of a Fortune 100 corporation, which extends existing knowledge transfer theory. The proposed framework integrates knowledge storage and knowledge administration within a model of effective knowledge transfer. This integrated framework encompasses five components: the actors engaged in the transfer of knowledge, the typology of organisational knowledge that is transferred between the actors, the mechanisms by which the knowledge transfer is carried out, the repositories where explicit knowledge is retained and the knowledge administrator equivalent whose function is to manage and maintain knowledge. The paper concludes that a ‘hybridisation’ of knowledge transfer approach, revealed by the framework, offers some promise in organisational applications.},

We use activity theory to describe, understand, and analyze the shipping activity in the international trade ecosystem with focus on physical objects and their related information. We find that the shipment becomes problematic and can be characterized as a runaway object in the heterogeneous and multiple organizational setting of international trade. Our analysis of shipping reveals (1) inefficient collaboration across loosely coupled activity systems and (2) fragmented information infrastructures. We propose the solution of Shipping Information Pipeline, a shared information infrastructure, thus facilitating collaboration in containerized shipping and contributing to lowering trade barriers. Shipping Information Pipeline can significantly improve containerized shipping resulting in estimated potential benefits of up to 4.7% growth in global GDP.},

This work addresses the turnaway of IT professionals in Brazil. The relevance of this research is supported by the shortage of adequately trained IT professionals to work in the productive sector in this country. Therefore, by using and adapting the extant scientific literature, research hypotheses associated with the IT professional turnaway phenomenon are developed and tested via structural equation modelling. It was then concluded that exhaustion with work in the IT area, job dissatisfaction, the need to acquire further experience to remain attractive in the job market, the need for professional growth and prior and conscious managerial capacity development for career transition are the main antecedents of the career transition of IT professionals to other functional areas.},

Thus, this research aims to assess the impact of this bank boat in the financial inclusion of a riverine population of Marajó Island in the state of Pará, which is the unit of analysis of this work. The research outcomes indicate that Agência Barco, via ICT, has partially managed to provide access to financial products and services that might be of interest to the riverine population of Marajó Island. However, the lack of basic financial education and context‐based issues related to the ICT infrastructure has been obstacles to the financial inclusion of this riverine population.

   abstract                      = {Abstract. With firms increasingly relying on ubiquitous computing to implement major business initiatives, it is becoming ever more necessary to understand the technological aspects of business developments. This paper analyzes the use of remote diagnostics systems in the manufacturing industry and discusses the opportunities and challenges for the early adopters. It pays specific attention to the impact on business aspects such as the value creation process consisting of relationships, roles, and architecture and the value proposal consisting of a business offer and customer value. The study shows how ubiquitous computing allows manufacturers to become remote service providers while customers can either become co‐creators of value or passive receivers of created value. Ubiquitous computing also creates possibilities for the manufacturing industry to design new kinds of business offers based on remote presence. Studying remote diagnostics systems shows that ubiquitous computing creates value when deployed in products, and not just in relation to individuals. Moreover, the design of the value‐creation process should not be limited to the single supplier or customer organization, as ubiquitous computing applications take no notice of organizational boundaries.},

The concentration of professional practice has been on management information systems for ‘big business’ and ‘book‐keeping’ systems for smaller businesses. This is a very limited view of the overall needs for information in organizations. Organizations may take many forms, and the nature of information systems that are needed will vary depending upon the particular form taken. This paper works from the organization structure literature towards a theory of information systems structure and strategy. Illustrative cases that support the hypotheses are described.},

Software development in the FreeBSD project is incremental in the sense that a stream of contributions, including bugfixes and minor and major new features, go into a single branch in the repository, the development branch (or ‘trunk’), and are required to preserve the software in a working state. This creates a succession of development releases, akin to the practice of frequent releasing argued by Eric S. Raymond in his essay ‘The Cathedral and the Bazaar’ to be the key to the success of Linux and other open source projects. The positive and negative impact of this approach is discussed based on a survey involving 72 project participants. On the positive side, the data indicate that it creates a highly motivating ‘see bug, fix bug, see bug fixed in new release’ life cycle, and helps integrate bugfixing with new development. On the negative side, the data indicates that the highly incremental model does not support the development of complex new features.},

The purpose of the reported research is to investigate the influence of information systems on work‐related outcomes. A model is derived from prior research that considers direct effects of quality of information product on job satisfaction along with indirect effects through role conflict and role ambiguity. Results from a field study of 368 users indicated that quality of information product has a positive relationship with job satisfaction. However, role ambiguity and role conflict mediated this relationship. A causal path model identified that quality of information product influenced job satisfaction through role conflict and role ambiguity. Role conflict and role ambiguity fully mediated the relationship between quality of information product and job satisfaction. The results identify the role of information systems in influencing users’ work related outcomes. In view of the importance of job satisfaction in motivating employees, IS designers and researchers should pay greater attention to the need for designing quality systems that not only meet their primary information delivery objectives, but also take into account the task and organizational design issues that may influence the work environment of users.},

First, it aims to investigate the various values users achieve with smartphones, which is a form of user‐empowering information technology (IT). The other objective is to introduce a means‐end chain approach into IT‐user studies. An important attraction of smartphones is their personalized environment, which is mainly provided by varied applications. The user personalization ability implies that users achieve diverse benefits with smartphones; that is, users decide what a smartphone is to them rather than adopt a given product. Thus, investigating what values users pursue with a smartphone (i.e. a value‐oriented approach) will give insights into understanding the users. To investigate user values in using smartphones, we conducted a laddering interview with 54 smartphone users and analyzed the data by using a means‐end chain approach to understand consumers' hierarchical value structure. This study contributes to value‐oriented research on user‐empowering IT by revelling how users benefit from smartphones. Furthermore, the study advances value‐oriented research by showing what users actually do with smartphones, from concrete activities to abstract values. In addition, a means‐end chain approach introduced in the study can be another angle for the investigation of user adoption of technology, in that it can describe IT use contexts and practices, which become an important object of analysis in the information systems research.},

The multitude of these factors hints at the adaptive nature of media choice. Alas, how a user engages with such factors and adaptively carries out media choice has remained understudied. We undertake a field study to explore the role of a plurality of choice factors and their interactions in shaping media choice processes and outcomes. In particular, we focus on how a user identifies relationships among plural choice factors while he or she works on his or her particular choice resulting in a similar outcome – email – given a large number of alternatives. Drawing upon a theory of affordances, we propose a systemic way of narrating the dynamics of media choice as a multi‐dimensional process where a user explores her or his surroundings – a niche – as to establish media affordances that will then help her or him achieve a communication goal. We identify five relational patterns of interactions among specific choice factors: reciprocity, emergence, complementarity, re‐exploration and actualisation. These patterns are shown to be emergent and highly interdependent. We conclude by reviewing future research avenues to formulate richer ‘ecological’ accounts of media choice.},

We argue that this model is important to explain how those at the bottom of the economic pyramid, who are often neglected, use FinTech innovations to create and run informal businesses. Our findings and model explain the dynamics between logics, actors, and mobile money at three levels: regulatory, payments infrastructure, and informal economy. We identify three corresponding effects as outcomes of economic empowerment for informal businesses: greater access to start‐up capital, new employment opportunities, and improved financial management. By illustrating these effects, our study contributes to a better understanding of how FinTech innovations offer a possible pathway to economic empowerment for informal businesses.},

This phenomenon, frequently referred to as IT consumerization, is gaining momentum. Employees increasingly are using their own devices and choosing their own software (eg, Google Apps, Skype or Dropbox) in addition to—or instead of—enterprise IT. Employees are turning from consumers of enterprise IT to IT deciders, bypassing the IS department to use what critics call “rogue IT.” While discouraged in some contexts, the influx of consumer IT into the workplace has been suggested to influence innovative behaviours among employees. Although the phenomenon is very prevalent, research lags in the operationalization of an IT consumerization model. In this paper, we take a close look at the antecedents and consequences of consumerization behaviours. We examine to what extent an individual's level of satisfaction with enterprise IT in juxtaposition with the level of perceived relative advantage of consumer IT over enterprise IT influences an individual's usage of consumer IT in the workplace; we also examine how organizational mandates and IT empowerment influences IT consumerization behaviours. Finally, we investigate the influence of IT consumerization on innovative behaviours at work.},

We highlight the tools used to mediate the activity, the activity motivation and the relevant stakeholders and examine the role of ‘contradictions’. Using the notion of connected activities, we also provide some theoretical basis for understanding the emergence of activities and conceptualising the impact of development projects, arguing that the outcome of an activity leads to/is consumed by other related activities.

   abstract                      = {The concept of affordances has become central in information systems literature. However, existing perspectives fall short in providing details on the relational aspect of affordances, which can influence actors' perception of them. To increase granularity and specificity in this regard, researchers have suggested that it be supplemented with other concepts or theories. In this article, we argue that the Heideggerian concepts of ‘familiarity’ and ‘referential totality’ are well suited for increasing our understanding of the relational aspects of affordances in information systems research. To explore this idea, we conducted a case study of a project concerning the development of a digital twin (i.e., digital representation of a physical asset) in the Norwegian grid sector. We found that users' familiarity with the digital twin totality enabled them to perceive digital twin affordances, and that without this familiarity, affordances remained latent for the users. Through our study, we offer a nuanced perspective on the relational aspect of affordance perception, contributing to affordance theory in that regard. Further, we contribute to practice and information systems research by providing valuable insights into how digital twins are understood and applied in practice.},

Consequently, our research points to the impact of ICT initiatives as step‐wise and attained over the long term, rather than disruptive and attained in the immediate term.},

Previous research has shown that situational context can be central for IS use continuance but has paid limited attention to its specific characteristics. Furthermore, the link between situational context and use continuance has remained unexplored in the novel area of “exergames,” which are defined as digital games requiring physical effort from the player that determines the outcome of the game. Studying exergames is deemed important due to their potential in providing health benefits for users, revenues for providers, and well‐being for societies. However, their potential remains unreached because users tend to discontinue usage after their initial experiences. To address these gaps, we investigate the relationships between specific situational characteristics and use continuance after critical exergaming incidents, in which the user has an exceptionally positive or negative experience. To do this, we quantitatively and qualitatively examined 461 actual critical exergaming incidents. Our findings provide a greater understanding of IS use continuance by revealing new knowledge about the relationships between specific situational characteristics (ie, purpose of use, type of gaming platform, social setting, place, and exertion level) and use continuance. We also offer explanations for these relationships, thus providing a first understanding of the previously unmapped area of how users behave situation‐dependently after critical exergaming incidents. Thus, we contribute both to the general IS continuance literature as well as to the specific area of exergaming. The context specificity of our study matches the calls for heavily contextualised IS research.},

   abstract                      = {Issues of power are often neglected in information systems (IS) studies and under‐theorised in IS research. Systems development methods (SDMs) are commonly used in the IT industry to coordinate the activities between developers and clients. The role of power in the relationship between clients and systems developers remains an important topic of research in information systems development (ISD). Yet, despite the importance of understanding this relationship better, there has only been a limited number of studies exploring the role that an SDM can play in influencing this relationship. What is not widely acknowledged or researched is how different forms of power are inscribed in and enacted through an SDM. The aim of this paper is to advance our understanding of different forms of power—here, obtrusive and unobtrusive power—to show how ISD concepts provide structures during the enactment of an SDM and thereby influence relationships between developers and clients. We present qualitative results from an exploratory case study within an IT division of a large international bank and interpret the results using Clegg's (1989) circuits of power (CoP). Our analysis shows that developers feel disempowered in relation to the client, with developers playing a cooperative but submissive role. Prior SDM enactment studies have either not encountered or not recognised cases where obtrusive and unobtrusive forms of power inscribed within the SDM directly determine the relationship between developers and the client. Our results are presented as a set of propositions explaining how obtrusive and unobtrusive power is inscribed in the SDM and the effect such inscription has on the enactment of the SDM.},

To narrow the age‐based “digital divide”, this research further develops the concept of digital capability and emphasises the link between older adults and their social context. Based on a qualitative inductive study of 33 participants, who included Chinese patients and their family members, we generate a novel theoretical model for understanding the process by which social activities may shape older adults' digital capabilities. Based on the model, we suggest two strategies that might encourage older adults to engage with HIT. This research contributes to the information systems (IS) literature by strengthening digital capability as a conceptual lens to investigate individuals' engagement with information communication technologies (ICTs). It also extends research on the social context for ICT use by revealing how social processes at multiple levels influence digital capability development. Finally, this study offers practical implications for governments and private sectors to encourage and promote ICT use by older adults.},

A critical examination and comparison of past times’‘traditional’ and present‐day ‘web‐based’ development shows that contemporary ISD can be seen as an accentuated evolution – rather than a revolution – of well‐known challenges and solutions. On this basis, (1) diversity; (2) knowledge; and (3) structure are identified as inherent and interrelated problems, while the practices for coping with these three challenges are (a) organization and specialization; (b) constant verbal communication and negotiation; and (c) pragmatic application of certain development methods and methodical concepts. We conclude that more research on the occurrence and interaction of problems and practices at, and between, different contextual levels (e.g. the business environment, company, project, team and individual levels) is needed to understand and assess (the gap between) ‘observed practice’ and ‘good practice’ across the many types of Web and non‐Web ISD projects conducted today. We outline a possible research agenda to investigate these issues.},

Software process improvement (SPI) approaches have been promoted as a promising remedy for this situation. The organizational implementation of such approaches is a crucial issue and attempts to introduce SPI into software organizations often fail. This paper presents a framework to understand, and subsequently successfully perform, the implementation of SPI innovations in software organizations. The framework consists of three perspectives on innovation: an individualist, a structuralist and an interactive process perspective. Applied to SPI, they emphasize different aspects of implementing SPI innovations. While the first focuses on leadership, champions and change agents, the second focuses on organization size, departmental and task differentiation and complexity, and the third perspective views the contents of the innovation, the social context and process of the implementation as related in an interactive process. We demonstrate the framework's applicability through two cases. We show that the three perspectives supplement each other and together provide a deeper understanding of the implementation process. Such understanding is crucial for the successful uptake of SPI approaches in software organizations.},

An experimental study, employing two samples from the USA and Switzerland, examined consumer responses to a new smartphone application that collects driving behavior data and provided converging support for these predictions. Specifically, the results revealed that a situation‐specific assessment of risks and benefits fully mediates the effect of dispositional factors on information disclosure. In addition, the results showed that privacy assessment is influenced by momentary affective states, indicating that consumers underestimate the risks of information disclosure when confronted with a user interface that elicits positive affect.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. The reluctance to report bad news about a project and its status is a known problem in software project management that can contribute to project failure. The reluctance to report bad news is heightened when it bears personal risks. Oftentimes, those who report bad news end up losing face. In extreme cases, they not only lose face, but may end up on the unemployment line. The need to preserve face is a powerful influence on social behaviour. While universal, it manifests itself differently in different cultures. To date, there have been no empirical studies of the extent to which culturally constituted views of face‐saving affect reporting of bad news on software projects. This is a particularly important topic given the increased prevalence of global, dispersed software development teams and offshore outsourcing of software development. In this study, we conducted a role‐playing experiment in the USA and in South Korea, to investigate the effect of culturally constituted views of face‐saving on the willingness to report bad news regarding a software development project. A blame‐shifting opportunity was chosen as the means to operationalize face‐saving in a culturally sensitive fashion. The two countries were chosen because they differ markedly in their views of face‐saving and the relative importance ascribed to two important aspects of face: lian and mianzi. Results reveal that the presence of a blame‐shifting opportunity had a significant effect on US subjects’ willingness to report bad news, but the effect on Korean subjects was not found to be statistically significant. In the absence of a blame‐shifting opportunity, we did not observe any significant differences between US and Korean subjects in willingness to report bad news. The implications of these findings are discussed.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. While a large body of research exists on the development and implementation of software, organizations are increasingly acquiring enterprise software packages [e.g. enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems] instead of custom developing their own software applications. To be competitive in the marketplace, software package development firms must manage the three‐pronged trade‐off between cost, quality and functionality. Surprisingly, prior research has made little attempt to investigate the characteristics of packaged software that influence management information system (MIS) managers’ likelihood of recommending purchase. As a result, both the criteria by which MIS managers evaluate prospective packaged systems and the attributes that lead to commercially competitive ERP software products are poorly understood. This paper examines this understudied issue through a conjoint study. We focus on ERP systems, which are among the largest and most complex packaged systems that are purchased by organizations. In a conjoint study, 1008 evaluation decisions based on hypothetical ERP software package profiles were completed by managers in 126 organizations. The study represents the first empirical investigation of the relative importance that managers ascribe to various factors that are believed to be important in evaluating packaged software. The results provide important insights for both organizations that acquire such systems and those that develop them. The results show that functionality, reliability, cost, ease of use and ease of customization are judged to be important criteria, while ease of implementation and vendor reputation were not found to be significant. Functionality and reliability were found to be the most heavily weighted factors. We conclude the paper with a detailed discussion of the results and their implications for software acquisition and development practice.},

In an increasingly dynamic business environment characterized by fast cycle times, shifting markets and unstable technology, a business organization’s survival hinges on its ability to align IT capabilities with business goals. To facilitate the successful introduction of new IT applications, issues of project risk must be addressed, and the expectations of multiple stakeholders must be managed appropriately. To the extent that users and developers may harbour different perceptions regarding project risk, areas of conflict may arise. By understanding the differences in how users and project managers perceive the risks, insights can be gained that may help to ensure the successful delivery of systems. Prior research has focused on the project manager’s perspective of IT project risk. This paper explores the issue of IT project risk from the user perspective and compares it with risk perceptions of project managers. A Delphi study reveals that these two stakeholder groups have different perceptions of risk factors. Through comparison with a previous study on project manager risk perceptions, zones of concordance and discordance that must be reconciled are identified.},

Whereas apps are useful, they also present new forms of privacy risk associated with users' personal and location data. However, these dangers do not appear to increase the perceived risk or reduce the trust consumers demonstrate when using apps. Many information technology (IT) trust indicators are well documented such as the quality of the IT, trust assurances, brand recognition and social influences. However, these traditional indicators appear to have a lesser impact on the adoption of mobile commerce via apps because of the nature of mobile‐app adoption and subsequent information disclosure. As a result, we draw from social cognitive theory and its construct of self‐efficacy in particular to explain perceived mobile‐app risk and provider trust. Through two controlled experiments, we demonstrate the strong direct effect of mobile‐computing self‐efficacy on users' initial trust in location‐based app vendors as well as their perceived risk of disclosing information – regardless of the actual trustworthiness of the app vendor. The results imply that being skilled in the latest smartphones and apps can cause users to place greater trust in app providers and perceive less risk in the app itself, even when the intentions of the app providers cannot be verified.},

Impact evaluation is one example of this intensive work, yet evaluation models seldom make power relations explicit or actionable. Furthermore, implicit models of data and knowledge on which impact evaluation processes rely also neglect power and social practice. The resulting problem is that power remains silent in development impact evaluation practice. In response, this article articulates an alternative, using Cultural Historical Activity Theory (CHAT) to analyse impact evaluation activities conducted by a UK‐based philanthropic donor and their grantee in India, a small non‐government organisation (NGO) doing rural development work. The analysis uses CHAT to illustrate how impact data, knowledge, and power are simultaneously generated during professional evaluation activities. The study broadens our view of impact and offers two contributions. Firstly, for researchers in information and communications technology for development (ICT4D) and knowledge management for development (KM4D), it contributes the application of a perspective on social practice, CHAT, to development evaluation. A novel extension to CHAT, the concept of “temporal activity chains,” is put forward to complement the established activity system frame. Secondly, the article demonstrates a practice‐based view of development impact evaluation for researchers and practitioners who wish to acknowledge and respond to the generation of unequal power dynamics during evaluation processes.},

This collaboration between corporate professionals and open source software community members is strikingly different from the early days of software development where for‐profit firms attempted to dominate and control the industry while attempting to throttle the success of independent developers offering an alternative, open source option. While many metaphors like trading zones, common pool resources and ecosystems have helped understand the phenomenon, the metaphors do not portray what the industry was like before and after the transition. We adopt a postcolonial metaphor as an analytical lens to examine such collaboration based on qualitative data gathered over three years from executives, managers and developers within corporations that engage in open source software development. Drawing on these insights, we then theorize a “Third Design Space,” based on the concept of the third space proposed by Bhabha. This metaphor encourages the cultivation of a new design environment, creation of new design associations and circulation of shared design resources. Together these practices and behaviours make it possible to nurture innovative methods and new rituals for designing software with results and methods that represent a distinct departure from the competitive and proprietary past, even creating innovative artefacts that could not have been created without the Third Design Space.},

Therefore, conceptual models and their modelling constructs should be based on theories about the world—that is, they should be grounded in ontology. Identity is fundamental to ontology and conceptual modelling because it addresses the very existence of objects and conceptual systems in general. Classification involves grouping objects that share similarities and delineating them from objects that fall under other concepts (qualitative identity). However, among objects that fall under the same concept, we must also distinguish between individual objects (individual identity). In this paper, we analyze the ontological question of identity, focusing specifically on institutional identity, which is the identity of socially constructed institutional objects. An institutional entity is a language construct that is ‘spoken into existence’. We elaborate on how institutional identity changes how we understand conceptual modelling and the models produced. We show that different models result if we base modelling on a property‐based conception of identity compared to an institutional one. We use the Bunge‐Wand‐Weber principles, which embrace a property‐based view of identity, as an anchor to the existing literature to point out how this type of ontology sidesteps identity in general and institutional identity in particular. We contribute theoretically by providing the first in‐depth ontological analysis of what the notion of institutional identity can bring to conceptual modelling. We also contribute a solid ontological grounding of identity management and the identity of things in digital infrastructures.},

Commercial off‐the‐shelf (COTS) software solutions have become commonplace in many domains, including the military, because they can provide standardized functionality with more responsiveness, a shorter time‐to‐market and at lower costs than custom‐made solutions. In one domain, however, that of certifiable safety‐critical applications, COTS software has not been adopted. One particular type of certifiable safety‐critical domain, the civil air transport industry, is under pressure to reduce cost and time‐to‐market while simultaneously increasing safety. Therefore, the use of COTS software, rather than exclusive reliance on custom‐made software, would appear to be a solution worthy of investigation. This study examines the certifiability of COTS software, its technical feasibility in this environment, and the ability to achieve the expected responsiveness, time‐to‐market and cost benefits. A detailed evaluation of COTS software and domain‐specific certification requirements is used to demonstrate that the certification of COTS‐based systems is possible. A prototype COTS‐based system (built upon a number of COTS components) is created to illustrate the technical feasibility of such a system in the civil air transport domain. Expected benefits from COTS solutions are evaluated both by examining process artefacts from the development of the COTS‐based system and by comparing this development process with the domain's traditional custom‐development process.},

It introduces a conceptual framework consisting of four dimensions drawn from entrepreneurship literature: primary mission, success criteria, resource mobilization and innovation approach – that characterize entrepreneurial impact sourcing service providers. These four dimensions are anchored across ideal types of social and commercial institutional logics to explicitly account for and capture the dual social and commercial value orientations of impact sourcing service providers as acknowledged in the literature. We evaluate the utility of this framework by using it to assess a US‐based business process outsourcing social enterprise that focuses on the underserved workforce of military veterans and spouses of military personnel. We found that this firm used social logic for both the firm's primary mission and the firm's resource mobilization; it used commercial logic for its success criteria, and it used both logics for its innovation. Our analysis of the case substantiates the applicability of the framework for capturing variation in how impact sourcing providers may selectively draw upon different logics across the four dimensions. © 2017 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

   abstract                      = {Mobile banking is an emerging application of mobile commerce that could become an additional revenue source to both banks and telecom service providers. It is a form of service convergence enabled by innovative technologies. Despite the alleged benefits of mobile banking, its acceptance has been short of industry expectations. One plausible explanation may be consumers' initial lack of trust in available services. The objective of our research is to reveal the mechanisms associated with the initial formation of people's trust in mobile banking and intention to use the service. For this, we attempt to understand the effect of four antecedent variables (structural assurances, relative benefits, personal propensity to trust and firm reputation) on shaping a person's initial trust in mobile banking and its usage intention. They represent four types of trust‐inducing forces: institutional offering (structural assurances), cognition (perceived benefits), personality (personal propensity) and firm characteristics (firm reputation). We examine individual significance of the selected antecedents and also their comparative reliability in explaining the two exogenous variables. The technical basis of our empirical research is the innovative mobile banking solution that uses cellphones with a built‐in smart chipset. The survey data are analyzed using structural equation modelling. The analysis showed that three variables (relative benefits, propensity to trust and structural assurances) had a significant effect on initial trust in mobile banking. Also, the perception of initial trust and relative benefits was vital in promoting personal intention to make use of related services. However, contrary to our expectation, the reputation as a firm characteristics variable failed to attract people to mobile banking.},

This study focuses on how to close the gap in cybersecurity skills through interest cultivation and self‐determined motivation. Our study shows that situational interest (SI) in cybersecurity along with situational motivational determinants (i.e., perceived learning autonomy and perceived relatedness) engendered self‐determined motivation toward cybersecurity training. Consequently, self‐determined motivation facilitated actual learning behaviour. Meanwhile, individual interest in cybersecurity created positive moderating effects in the relationships between self‐determination and its key antecedents (i.e., perceived relatedness and situational interest).

Over the last decade, British health policy has increasingly considered the role of information and information technologies in the provision of health care. Recently, there is a growing interest in new health applications, often referred to as telemedicine and telehealth, and incorporating a diverse range of services that can be provided in electronic form over various telecommunications networks. This paper discusses how such use of information and communication technologies (ICTs) in health acquires meanings through a policy process, and what implications it has for telehealth in particular. This is done through a hermeneutic exploration of four principal UK health policy papers published between 1989 and 1998.},

Its successful outcome is very often essential to overall project success. However, there is a lack of systematically conducted empirical research on the competencies of RAs. This paper addressed this gap by conducting 64 interviews at eight major North American and European financial services companies. Our qualitative research design follows an interpretive approach and uses critical incident technique. We develop a competency model, which specifies 16 critical competencies, and integrates contextual and situational factors as well as results variables. ‘Consulting others’, ‘Testing assumptions and investigating’ and ‘Explaining concepts and opinions’ were the most frequently identified competencies. This indicates that for an effective analyst, close interaction and communication with customers is indeed crucial – but of equally importance is the critical questioning of the expressed needs. Surprisingly, applying specific tools and advanced techniques did not seem to play a significant role from the interviewees' perspective. This study contributes to theory as it is the first to elaborate a competency model for RAs. It also provides a foundation for the development of competency‐based training in companies and universities.},

We believe that it provides additional insights on the nature of the impact of IT investments on productivity. The results from our study are compared with findings from a previous study that has also used the same data set. While the results of a previous study indicate that IT investments have a positive but uniform impact on productivity, our study suggests that the impact of IT on productivity is not uniform but is contingent on other complementary factors. Our findings describe that the complementary relationship exists between IT and non‐IT related investments. Thus, improved organizational productivity cannot be expected from investment in IT alone but only together with non‐IT investments. Our findings also point out that further investment may not necessarily bring on higher organizational productivity.},

To shed light on social media's impact on organizational life, this paper draws on an interpretive case study to investigate a global security company's efforts to implement a digitally enabled social network as part of a cultural change effort. Conceptually, based on the theory of IT–culture conflict, this paper underscores the interplay between organizational culture and technology. Our study finds that conflicts can arise between employees' workplace values and the values they ascribe to social media. This can result in an IT–culture system conflict, which organizations can address using policy‐based, socialization‐based and leadership‐based mechanisms aimed at bringing cultural values and social media site values into alignment.},

The recent proliferation of low‐cost computer networks has driven the development of a new type of organization, in which geographical and time constraints to collaboration among process teams have been gradually removed. As these organizations have to cope with a fast pace of change, they rely increasingly on distributed and asynchronous process improvement (PI) groups to redesign their processes. Yet little is known about the effects of asynchronous group support systems (GSSs) on PI groups. We investigate the effects of asynchronous GSSs on PI groups through a two‐stage action research study of 38 such groups in three organizations, one in Brazil and two in New Zealand, over 4 years and 4 months. Different PI groups voluntarily conducted all, part or none of their communication through an e‐mail conferencing (EC) tool. The research suggests that EC support causes a decrease in the organizational costs associated with PI groups, which, combined with an increase in the number of possible simultaneous PI groups, generates an increase in overall organizational PI efficiency. The research also suggests a neutral overall effect of EC support on PI group outcome quality. Two explanatory causal models summarizing these effects are developed, and implications for research and industry practice are discussed.},

Such variables are typically conceptualized as factors in structural equation modelling (SEM). In spite of their desirable characteristics, PLS methods suffer from a fundamental problem: Unlike covariance‐based SEM, they do not deal with factors, but with composites, and as such do not fully account for measurement error. This leads to biased parameters, even as sample sizes grow to infinity. Anchored on a new conceptual foundation, we discuss a method that builds on the consistent PLS technique and that estimates factors, fully accounting for measurement error. We provide evidence that this new method shares the property of statistical consistency with covariance‐based SEM but, like classic PLS methods, has greater statistical power. Moreover, our method provides correlation‐preserving estimates of the factors, which can be used in a variety of other tests. For readers interested in trying it, the new method is implemented in the software WarpPLS. Our detailed discussion should facilitate the implementation of the method in any numeric computing environment, including open source environments such as R and GNU Octave.},

The ‘10‐times rule’ has been a favourite because of its simplicity of application, even though it tends to yield imprecise estimates. We propose two related methods, based on mathematical equations, as alternatives for minimum sample size estimation in PLS‐SEM: the inverse square root method, and the gamma‐exponential method. Based on three Monte Carlo experiments, we demonstrate that both methods are fairly accurate.

   abstract                      = {This paper presents a review of the organizational learning literature that points to process improvement (PI) groups as an appropriate too for organizational knowledge communication. Based on this review, the impact of support provided by a class of groupware systems, email conferencing (EC) on knowledge dissemination in organizations is examined in the context of PI groups. Data were collected through an action research project, in which the researcher facilitated seven PI groups in two organizations with the support of an EC system implemented with Novel/ Groupwise and using a group methodology for PI called MetaProi. The study suggests that, overall, EC support seems to have a positive impact on knowledge dissemination in organizations when used in combination with a group methodology for PI. EC support effects on PI groups can be summarized as: (a) a reduction in, first, the influence of distance and other physical obstacles to the participation of members from different departments in PI groups, and, second, in the disruption that group discussions are likely to cause for individual group members, particularly when these members are from different departments; (b) a reduction in interdepartmental conflict obstacles to the formation of PI groups; and (c) an increase or decrease in individual learning in PI groups, depending on the complexity of the issues being discussed and the clarity of electronic contributions by members. Organizational implications of these research findings are discussed.},

They are, in general, the lack of direct user participation and the lack of designer accountability in the design process. In an attempt to solve the problem, we develop a new design method, the User Participation and Designer Accountability (UPDA) method. It involves users' direct manipulation of colour cards, which contain the contents of simple design charts. These cards are also made accessible to everyone involved in the design process and form the basis upon which the designer can be questioned. We have applied the UPDA method and so far the reactions are very positive.},

A great deal of research has examined specific phenomena, such as adoption antecedents and design methods. However, it is unclear what we know in totality, including what research streams exist, how they fit together, and fruitful opportunities for new knowledge development. We combine scientometric and systematic literature review methodologies to examine 7 dimensions of an adapted theoretical framework: initiation; development; implementation; exploitation; the role of the external competitive environment; role of internal organizational environment; and product, service, and process outcomes. From a macro perspective, we find vastly uneven coverage of research streams, diversity and diffusiveness of research, and knowledge and learning as an underlying conceptual pillar. Combined with our summary of each of the 7 research streams, these findings suggest several areas of future research, which we develop by identifying oppositions and tensions.},

   abstract                      = {The increasing popularity of Software as a Service has strongly affected the established business model of on‐premise enterprise software. Software as a Service has distinctive characteristics of disruptive innovations that typically create several difficulties for incumbent firms, in particular with regard to adapting business models. To date, however, little empirical understanding exists regarding the dynamics of business model change – a topic of special importance to the highly dynamic software industry, which is characterised by rapid and regular emergence of disruptive innovations. As disruptive innovations require gathering distant knowledge and experimenting with new ideas, this study addresses theoretical gaps regarding the role of absorptive capacity and organisational ambidexterity in the process of business model change owing to the emergence of a disruptive innovation. Drawing on evidence from multiple case studies of six incumbent vendors of enterprise resource‐planning software and informed by a thorough review of related secondary data, we investigate the pace and path of incumbents' business model adaptations. We propose a theoretical model that refines prior literature on absorptive capacity and organisational ambidexterity, particularly with regard to the process of business model change. This study identifies further technological factors that determine how and why incumbents change business models. In addition, our study provides in‐depth insights on the technological trajectory of enterprise resource‐planning software switching from on‐premise to on‐demand software services. © 2016 Blackwell Publishing Ltd},

Following existing work on the contextualization of theories and drawing on the resource‐based view of the firm (RBV), we develop an RBV of IT‐based synergies in two steps. First, we adopt existing context‐specific constructs and relationships from prior work on IT governance capabilities, IT relatedness, and synergies to develop a preliminary contextualization of the RBV. Second, to further refine our theoretical framework, we conduct an exploratory field study that includes interviews with 26 CIOs and other IT executives from 21 multibusiness firms. Our findings suggest that IT governance capabilities lead to IT‐based synergies through IT relatedness and business process relatedness. We found regulation‐oriented IT governance capabilities (IT roles and IT processes) to increase IT relatedness, while consensus‐oriented IT governance capabilities (IT groups and relational capabilities) had a positive effect on business process relatedness. Our results suggest that, in isolation, IT and business process relatedness lead to IT cost synergies, while collectively enabling IT‐induced business synergies. Our study is among the first to treat IT relatedness as an endogenous construct and to explicitly integrate business process relatedness into the IT governance domain. Our context‐specific decomposition of IT governance capabilities helps to better explain their links to IT and business process relatedness. These findings contribute to a better understanding of the tension between IT‐based synergies and business‐IT alignment. Decision‐makers are guided in developing IT governance capabilities to achieve IT‐based synergies.},

The former approach uses variants of e‐commerce business models to drive service innovation whereas the latter entails changes to the backend for driving system efficiency and integration, which later serve for reorganising and improving service provision. Each approach presents a different way of assembling services, infrastructures, people and business models. The ramifications of each assemblage to service innovation are less understood. This paper seeks to examine the intended and unintended consequences of these two contrasting approaches inductively and deductively. Our findings show that a frontend approach enables quick improvements and enacts a variety of structures, with each structure inscribing a set of new path‐dependent routines in the infrastructures. In the backend approach it took longer to introduce new services. Yet the services were of a higher quality and required less modification in the long run. Quantitative analyses confirmed these findings. We attributed the alignment advantage of backend approach to better interdepartmental collaboration organised around a technology platform for system and service integration, concentrating resources on a coherent rather than a diverse set of business models. This approach realigns practices and routines and technology internally, whereas the explorative, diverse use of business models in the frontend approach for service innovation is less sustainable.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. In this paper, we examine efforts undertaken by two cities – Atlanta and LaGrange, Georgia – to redress the digital divide. Atlanta's initiative has taken the form of community technology centres where citizens can come to get exposure to the internet, and learn something about computers and their applications. LaGrange has taken a very different approach, providing free internet access to the home via a digital cable set‐top box. Using theoretical constructs from Bourdieu, we analysed how the target populations and service providers reacted to the two initiatives, how these reactions served to reproduce the digital divide, and the lessons for future digital divide initiatives. In our findings and analysis, we see a reinforcement of the status quo. When people embrace these initiatives, they are full of enthusiasm, and there is no question that some learning occurs and that the programmes are beneficial. However, there is no mechanism for people to go to the next step, whether that is technical certification, going to college, buying a personal computer or escaping the poverty that put them on the losing end of the divide in the first place. This leads us to conclude that the Atlanta and LaGrange programmes could be classified as successes in the sense that they provided access and basic computer literacy to people lacking these resources. However, both programmes were, at least initially, conceived rather narrowly and represent short‐term, technology‐centric fixes to a problem that is deeply rooted in long‐standing and systemic patterns of spatial, political and economic disadvantage. A persistent divide exists even when cities are giving away theoretically ‘free’ goods and services.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. The now familiar and longstanding discussion on the status of the field of management information systems (MIS) consists of at least two themes – the lack of coherence in MIS and the question of rigour vs. relevance (academic vs. practical concerns). The research questions we pose here ask: what themes or ideas represent the centre of MIS or its zones of coherence – or is diversity and fragmentation the rule? and will the centre or zones change over time? Within MIS research, is there evidence of theory building that contributes to a cumulative research tradition? Using a co‐word analysis approach – to analyse the patterns in discourse by measuring the association strengths of terms representative of relevant publications – the researchers found 62 specific centres of coherence. The data documented a high degree of change in centres of coherence over time. Evidence of theory building was extremely weak. A cumulative research tradition remains elusive. MIS centres of coherence change over time – we think, partly in response to practical pressures. We suggest that MIS opens a richer and more difficult debate on its theory, practice, and identity as a discipline in the 21st century university.},

Data were analyzed using causal mapping. Major findings included: (1) that definitions of success may differ by unit of analysis (e.g., developer, project, organization) and that the relationship among these definitions are complex; (2) a very large number of variables impacting project success were identified; (3) a number of important variables exist in complex (non‐linear) relationships with project success; and (4) the majority of interviewees linked the use of UML to project success.},

Challenging this assumption, we argue that the salient contextual characteristics of MP applications compel a reconsideration and problematization of research on MP adoption and use. Drawing on network effect theory, we examined how contextual network effects and contextual network types determine MP consumer loyalty. Using a mixed methods design, we find that direct network effects (i.e., network size, network centrality, network capability), indirect network effects (i.e., platform–application complementarity, application–service complementarity, service–strategy complementarity) and negative network effects (i.e., general institutional structure, general structural assurance, local institutional structure and local structural assurance) are key determinants of perceived benefits, which further promote MP consumer loyalty. Furthermore, except for general institutional structure and general structural assurance, all of the network effects are important predictors of switching costs, which influence MP consumer loyalty. Finally, the impacts of network effects on MP consumer loyalty differ between consumer‐ and service‐oriented networks. Our study enriches the IS literature by problematizing the core assumption underlying the MP adoption and use research and offering a contextual explanation of MP consumer loyalty. Our work also provides practitioners with insights into how to better leverage network effects on MP consumer loyalty.},

A key advantage of NeuroIS is its ability to provide insights into human cognition beyond those obtained using behavioural techniques alone. Nevertheless, in neuroscience, there is renewed interest in examining behaviour together with neurophysiological methods to better inform our understanding of neural processes. In this research opinion article, we argue that in the field of NeuroIS, there is an opportunity for hybrid programs of study that combine neurophysiological and behavioural methods in a complementary manner. We outline four strategies for designing complementary neurophysiological and behavioural experiments in a research program: (1) observe the relationship between neural processes and behavioural change; (2) combine neurophysiological and behavioural methods to enhance internal, external, and ecological validity; (3) extend, rather than replicate, experiments based on theory; and (4) use neurophysiological and behavioural experiments together to evaluate IT artefact design. By applying these strategies, researchers can more effectively design programs using complementary neurophysiological and behavioural methods, which, in turn, can help to provide richer insights into the phenomena under study as well as accelerate the advancement of IS knowledge.},

This article addresses this critical issue and fills research gaps by proposing and testing a research model of MMORPG addiction. Building on the conceptual foundation of the hedonic management model of addiction and the technology affordance perspective, we develop a research model explaining how MMORPG affordances (ie, achievement, social and immersion affordances) are associated with the duality of hedonic effects (ie, perceived positive mood enhancement and perceived negative mood reduction) and the extent of MMORPG addiction. Using structural equation modelling, we empirically test our research model with 406 MMORPG players. The results show that both perceived positive mood enhancement and perceived negative mood reduction positively correlate with the extent of MMORPG addiction. Furthermore, achievement and immersion affordances are positively associated with the duality of hedonic effects, whereas social affordance is not. Our study contributes to the growing body of technology addiction literature by revealing the relationships between the two hedonic effects and the extent of MMORPG addiction, and by offering a contextualised explanation of the role of MMORPG affordances in these relationships. We offer an alternative perspective on the far‐reaching, unintended relationships between technological affordances and addictive technology use. Our study provides game developers and policymakers with insights into preventing MMORPG addiction to create an entertaining, healthy virtual playground.},

However, the extant literature lacks empirical evidence on how the underlying effects of SPT performance and its team‐supportive factors operate and influence software project performance. From the knowledge perspective, this study adopts dynamic capabilities theory and considers the learning ability and absorptive capacity of software project teams to develop a theoretical model to address this gap. The results of an empirical examination of the model with 135 software project teams advance our understanding of how team‐level learning antecedents—experience, communication quality and trust—dynamically facilitate teams' absorptive capacity (AC) when they conduct SPT, which in turn reinforces project performance. The mediating effects of the proposed model are unveiled and discussed, and theoretical implications as well as practical guidance for how AC and these factors promote SPT and project performance are suggested.},

However, our analysis found that while adopting SQBP, researchers focused primarily on rational cost‐and‐benefit analysis, rather than on the fundamental tenet of SQBP that highlights ‘bias’ in users' decision‐making on account of their cognitive limitations that lead to bounded rationality. In addition, some of the key constructs used in SQBP were not properly interpreted or were oversimplified in their operationalization. This research note aims to provide guidance for utilizing and analysing SQBP and its constructs for future IS user resistance/adoption research. Because SQBP provides unique insights into ‘bias’ in human decision‐making in its presentation of bounded rationality, accurate interpretation of its concepts and their investigation can help better understand the different sources of user resistance derived from the status quo bias during new IS and ICT implementation. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

   abstract                      = {Over the past two decades, several studies have investigated the factors that lead to and away from individuals' reporting of truthful status information on IT projects. These studies have typically considered the reporting decisions of an individual who is aware of negative status information that is attributed to others' errors. These previous studies have seldom examined the situation in which the individual is considering whether to report information about his or her own self‐committed error on the project. In this study, we consider this largely unexamined phenomenon. In this context, we focus on the influences that different affective states and a personality trait (conscientiousness) can have on error reporting decisions. Specifically, we investigate how different moods (i.e. positive vs. negative) and conscientiousness can influence error reporting decisions in the context of an IT project. Based on the results from a controlled laboratory experiment, we find that individuals in a negative mood are more willing to report their errors compared to individuals in a positive mood. Conscientiousness also positively influences individuals' willingness to report errors, and it also has an indirect effect through cost–benefit differential (i.e. one's perceptions of benefits relative to costs). Additionally, mood is found to moderate the relationship between conscientiousness and willingness to report. We discuss the implication of our findings and directions for future research and for practice. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Specifically, we suggest that the growth mindset of IT PM ability promotes prospective achievement motivation and can lead IT project managers to escalate their commitment to an IT project despite negative feedback suggesting that the project may not be completed successfully. Through a series of three experiments with 351 IT project managers, we obtained consistent support for our hypotheses suggesting that the growth mindset of IT PM ability promotes IT project escalation and this effect is partially mediated by anticipated regret about project failure and anticipated likelihood of project success. In addition, in the three experiments we found that when the project involves an unfamiliar technology the indirect effect of the growth mindset of IT PM ability through anticipated likelihood of project success is stronger than when the project involves a familiar technology.},

Drawing upon adaptation theory, this study explores how participants adapt to the use of email to handle conflict. Extensive data were obtained during a 6‐month field study of a case of cross‐border inter‐organisational collaboration in East Asia. We observed that the individuals involved in the cross‐border partnership used email as a lean form of communication to stop covert conflict from explicitly emerging. In contrast to prior research on the leanness of email in managing conflict, we found that under the described conflict situation the very leanness of email was appreciated and thus, exploited by those concerned to manage the conflict situation. Specifically, we identified 4 key conflict‐triggered adaptation strategies, namely, interaction avoidance, disempowering, blame‐protection, and image‐sheltering that drove the ways in which email was adapted to maintain organisational partnerships under conflict.},

The models were empirically validated in the government‐to‐citizen (G2C) anti/counter‐terrorism (ACT) service domain by a telephone survey administered to a sample of 500 US residents systematically drawn from the mainland USA. The structured telephone survey questionnaire measured respondents' intentions to use Web‐based ACT services and their beliefs and attitudes towards various ACT service providers (e.g. the Federal Bureau of Investigation, Department of Homeland Security, local police, non‐governmental organisations (NGOs) and news companies) and media (e.g. Web, email, telephone, TV, newspapers, postal mail). The results of multiple‐regression analysis of the 500 interview responses show that the source–channel choice model can explain the service usage intentions as well as, or better than, the TPB‐based acceptance model. Both service source and channel exerted consistent and substantive effects on citizens' intention to use ACT services, explaining, on average, more than 43% of variance in the dependent variable. In contrast, subjective norms in the TPB‐based model seemed to have a marginal effect. Privacy protection and integrity of the service source appeared to be key antecedents of source preference, while the influence of channel attributes on channel preference varied widely depending on the type of services. This study provides an empirical basis for the validity and applicability of the source–channel choice model and offers insightful and prescriptive knowledge for e‐government initiatives and service providers.},

Technology artifacts (such as hardware and software), information artifacts (such as a message) and social artifacts (such as a charitable act) are different kinds of artifacts that together interact in order to form the IS artifact. We illustrate the knowledge value of the IS artifact concept with material from three cases. The result is to restore the idea that the study of design in IS needs to attend to the design of the entire IS artifact, not just the IT artifact. This result encourages an expansion in the use of design science research methodology to study broader kinds of artifacts.},

Where the soft systems methodology (SSM) is used in the development of organizational information systems a clear division exists between the use of SSM to identify what information systems are required and conventional development activities in which it is decided how those information systems will be supplied. Discussion of how SSM might be more closely linked to conventional information systems development methodologies has been concentrated upon process‐focused approaches to information systems development. This has been partly due to a perceived mismatch between the underlying philosophies of SSM and the alternative data‐focused development methodologies. This paper argues that this perception may be mistaken; not only do the existing forms of data analysis have a large though unacknowledged subjective component but the SSM concept of appreciation may provide a model of human sense‐making that the data‐focused approaches currently lack and from which they may benefit. The idea of appreciation also allows that an alternative, interpretative form of data analysis might be used within SSM. It is therefore the conclusion of this paper that some closer integration of SSM with data‐focused approaches to information systems development is theoretically feasible and may be practically desirable. A number of possible advantages of such integration are described.},

The self‐regulatory approach centers on the effect of organizational justice and personal ethical objections against internet abuses. The results of this study suggest that the self‐regulatory approach is more effective than the sanction‐based command‐and‐control approach. Based on the self‐regulatory approach, organizational justice not only influences IUP compliance intention directly but also indirectly through fostering ethical objections against internet abuses. This research provides empirical evidence of two additional effective levers for enhancing security policy compliance: organizational justice and personal ethics.},

Using recent evidence gathered from six in‐depth cases studies in the UK and a telephone‐based survey, this paper will illustrate how the development of interfirm networks has facilitated the emergence of new interfirm collaboration in strategic areas. The empirical evidence has been drawn from the retailing, motor manufacturing and electronics industries. To conclude, the paper will highlight several key issues that have emerged from the study, identify three layers of barriers to the development of interfirm networks, and outline a future research agenda.},

It is proposed that a method that has been developed specifically to aid the user and analyst to appreciate a perceived problem situation might provide a useful aid in the process of identifying objects from the situation which are meaningful to the user. [An attempt has been made to use terminology that is consistent with that used in object‐oriented analysis. However, at times this terminology may be at variance with some of the interpretivist ideas put forward (e.g. the term ‘user’ is adopted, although the authors argue that the notion of ‘client’ is more appropriate to emphasize the increased involvement and responsibility of the ‘user’ in the approach advocated)]. The ability to achieve this is expected to facilitate the appropriate mapping of these meaningful objects into a technical specification through object‐oriented methods and to encourage user acceptance of the resulting computer‐based information system.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. Much of our prior knowledge of information systems (IS) usage is based on utilitarian systems such as personal productivity software and organizational applications. However, new generations of systems, such as online video games (OVGs), have since emerged that aim at enhancing users' hedonic outcomes like entertainment rather than utilitarian outcomes such as productivity. Prior models of utilitarian system usage provide a limited understanding of one's usage of hedonic systems, given the motivational differences between using these two types of systems. Theoretical modifications instead are required to extend the current models to hedonic systems. Expanding the research on attitude theories, we propose an initial model for usage of interactive hedonic systems, replacing perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use with perceived enjoyment and social image as the core cognitive drivers of usage, and further linking these beliefs to different technological attributes. The initial model is empirically validated using a survey of OVG usage among 485 student subjects. For IS usage research, this paper proposes and validates one of the earliest usage models of hedonic systems. For practitioners, this study provides some guidelines for manufacturers of hedonic systems on how to derive the most return on their system development efforts.},

However, viewing TMS as a second‐order construct that mixes cognitive (specialty and credibility) and behavioural (coordination) components leads to confusion and increases the difficulty in interpreting study results. This study follows the concept proposed by one recent study and attempts to distinguish between behavioural and cognitive components. Furthermore, drawing on the need for diverse members to be integrated behaviourally, we also attempt to extend the TMS research stream by proposing a more comprehensive behavioural component of TMS. We argue that to obtain better teamwork outcomes, information system development (ISD) team members need to integrate the expertise possessed by each individual, make decisions jointly and interlink all individual actions. In light of this, our study aims to replace coordination with team behavioural integration, a more comprehensive behavioural consequence of cognition and explore the critical role of behavioural integration in ISD teams by understanding its impact on ISD teamwork project team performance. The study result, based on data collected from 205 information system project managers, supports our hypotheses that expertise specialty, credibility and their interaction positively affect team behavioural integration. This, in turn, leads to enhanced project team performance.},

As organizations are becoming distributed and dynamic, they will be increasingly populated by multiple functional, geographical, hierarchical and professional boundaries. The inherent complexity of such settings makes it difficult for organizations to leverage their boundary‐spanning practices. Information technology (IT) systems have been hailed as a critical enabler of boundary spanning. However, there is little knowledge on how organizations are affected by the introduction of different types of IT systems. Building on an interpretive case study of Swedish transport organizations, this paper explores consequences of sensor technology for boundary spanning. The paper contributes with an understanding of what coexisting use contexts mean for boundary‐spanning practices. A theoretical implication is that such multi‐contextuality requires an integrative view on boundary spanning that combines insights from the organizational innovation and work practice literatures.},

Based on research on individual creativity, we propose a conceptual model integrating users' previous experience, idea presentation characteristics and feedback valence to explain the likelihood of idea implementation. We validate our research model with a panel data analysis of 43 550 ideas submitted by 16 360 users in the MIUI new product development community hosted by Xiaomi, a large electronics manufacturing company in China. We find an inverted U‐shaped relationship between users' past successful experience and idea implementation. Furthermore, the length of ideas is positively associated with the likelihood of idea implementation. There is also an inverted U‐shaped relationship between supporting evidence and idea implementation. Finally, we demonstrate the negative effect of positive feedback and the positive effect of negative feedback on idea implementation. These findings offer rich insights to understand the phenomenon of open innovation better. Theoretical and practical implications are discussed.},

Furthermore, previous literature suggests that people may not always make privacy‐related decisions through effortful and deliberate information processing. Drawing on the perspective of boundary regulation and dual process theories, this study clarifies the consequences of role conflict on SNSs. A theoretical model is developed to examine the effect of role conflict regarding privacy risk and perceived control, which, in turn, impact self‐disclosure behaviour, as well as how this process is moderated by high‐ versus low‐effort processing. The results of 4 experiments provide strong support for our model. The implications for theory and practice are discussed.},

With an increasing number of IT projects in developing countries such as China, it is important to understand the risks they are experiencing on IT projects. To date, there has been little research documenting Asian perceptions of IT project risk. In this research, we examine the risks identified by Chinese senior executives (SEs) and project managers (PMs), and compare these two groups. The importance of top management support in IT projects is well documented. Prior research has shown that from the perspective of IT PMs, lack of support from SEs is the number one risk in IT projects. Surprisingly, senior executives' perceptions towards IT project risk have never been systematically examined. One reason why lack of support from senior executives continues to represent a major risk may be that senior executives themselves do not realize the critical role that they can play in helping to deliver successful projects. In this study, we use the Delphi method to compare the risk perceptions of senior executives and project managers. By comparing risk factors selected by each group, zones of concordance and discordance are identified. In terms of perceived importance ascribed to risk factors, PMs tend to focus on lower‐level risks with particular emphasis on risks associated with requirements and user involvement, whereas SEs tend to focus on higher‐level risks such as those risks involving politics, organization structure, process, and culture. Finally, approaches for dealing with risk factors that are seen as important by both SEs and PMs are provided.},

Green information systems (Green IS) initiatives can assist organizations in reaching their environmental goals by providing the ability to reduce the environmental impacts of information technology (IT) manufacturing, operations and disposal; facilitate transparency and enhance the efficiency of organizational resources and business processes; and foster eco‐products through technological innovation. However, the nature and type of benefits such initiatives can accrue remain poorly understood, and accordingly, IT executives struggle to integrate environmental aspects in the corporate strategy and to launch Green IS initiatives. This paper clarifies the mechanisms that link organizational beliefs about environmental sustainability to Green IT and Green IS actions undertaken, and the organizational benefits that accrue from these actions. Using data from a global survey of 118 senior‐level IT executives, we find that Green IS strategies mediate the relationship between environmental orientation and the implementation of Green IT practices and Green IS practices, which in turn lead to organizational benefits in the form of cost reductions, corporate reputation enhancement and Green innovation capabilities. Our findings have implications for the potential of IS to enable organizations' environmental sustainability and also for the differentiation of Green IT and Green IS practices.},

The findings illuminate that ISJ has published articles in the area of information systems development at a much higher rate than its counterparts. The analyses also illustrate that ISJ has embraced broader philosophical and methodological underpinnings than other SSB8 journals.},

   abstract                      = {Organisations increasingly rely on information and related systems, which are also a source of risk. Unfortunately, employees represent the greatest risk to organisational information because they are the most frequent source of information security breaches. To address this ‘weak link’ in organisational security, most organisations have strict information security policies (ISPs) designed to thwart employee information abuses. Regrettably, these ISPs are only partially effective because employees often ignore them, circumvent them or even do the opposite of what management desires. Research on attempts to increase ISP compliance has produced similarly mixed results. Lack of compliance with ISPs is a widespread organisational issue that increasingly bears disproportionately large direct and qualitative costs that undermine strategy. Consequently, the purpose of our study was to contribute to the understanding of both motivations to comply with new ISPs and motivations to react negatively against them. To do so, we proposed an innovative model, the control‐reactance compliance model (CRCM), which combines organisational control theory – a model that explains ISP compliance – with reactance theory – a model used to explain ISP noncompliance. To test CRCM, we used a sample of 320 working professionals in a variety of industries to examine the likely organisational outcomes of the delivery of a new ISP to employees in the form of a typical memo sent throughout an organisation. We largely found support for CRCM, and this study concludes with an explanation of the model's contributions to research and practice related to organisational ISP compliance.},

To better understand this dilemma, we use fairness theory (FT) and reactance theory (RT) to explain why employees may blame organisations for and retaliate against enhanced information security policies (ISPs). We tested our model with 553 working professionals and found support for most of it. Our results show that organisational trust can decrease reactive CA. FT suggests that explanation adequacy (EA) is an important factor that builds trust after an event. Our results also suggest that trust both fully mediates the relationship between EA and CA and partially mediates the relationship between perceived freedom restrictions related to enhanced ISPs and reactive CA. EA also had a strong negative relationship with freedom restrictions. Moreover, organisational security education, training and awareness (SETA) initiatives decreased the perceptions of external control and freedom restrictions and increased EA, and advance notification of changes increased EA. We also included 14 control variables and rival explanations to determine with more confidence what drove reactive CA in our context. Notably, the deterrence theory (DT)‐based constructs of sanction severity, certainty and celerity had no significant influence on reactive CA. We provide support for the importance of respectful communication efforts and SETA programmes, coupled with maximising employee rights and promoting trust and fairness to decrease reactive CA. These efforts can protect organisations from falling victim to their own organisational security efforts.},

However, research regarding the potential benefits of an online community on such platforms is unclear. Furthermore, prior research often assumes the single dimensionality of prior experience, whose impacts on crowdsourcing performance are also inconclusive. Building on knowledge collaboration and cognitive diversity research, we model the direct effects of introducing an online community on contestant performance and the moderating effects of the amount of experience and experience diversity. Leveraging a natural quasi‐experiment in a large crowdsourcing contest platform, we collected 24 months of contestant data to test our hypotheses. Our propensity score matching and difference in differences analysis demonstrated that contestants' performance (winning contests and crowdsourcing income) increases significantly with the presence of an online community. Additionally, the positive effect of an online community on performance is more pronounced for contestants with less experience and those with more diverse experience. Our findings provide insights into the causality of incorporating an online community and inform community investment decisions for crowdsourcing contest platforms.},

Through the lenses of systemic and episodic power, together with an organisational conflict model, this longitudinal, qualitative case study explores the dynamics of power and conflict and their effects in an inter‐organisational information systems development project. This study highlights that the bureaucratic, social and technical setup of the project forms a foundational system from which specific power practices emerge, in this case, the practices of hiding, storytelling and bargaining. The power practices have both restrictive and productive effects on conflict, but the practices cannot easily escape the confines of the foundational system and continue to cause the resurfacing of different manifestations of latent conflict inherent in the system. As a result, both ‘power to’ (systemic power) and ‘power over’ (episodic power) can escalate project conflict, and rational conflict management for gaining ‘win‐win’ resolutions may not be in the stakeholders' interests. Thus, strategies for openly managing political conflicts should be considered.},

The study used purposeful sampling of companies that have an expressed interest in OS, and the survey was conducted using a set of pre‐prepared questions. Its goal was to investigate the extent to which OS has influenced business thinking, as seen from the standpoint of stakeholders. We found that uptake is much higher than reported in earlier studies, but as with previous studies, activity is still concentrated in small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs). There is increased evidence of interest beyond the simple use of OS components at the infrastructure level. Further, a significant proportion of the companies studied are supporting the OS community as well as benefiting from it. Support includes participation in existing projects and the release of new software under OS licenses.},

In response, the work here presents a novel model (and associated software instantiation) that integrates factors through Key Performance Indicators and Key Quality Indicators. The mapping is incorporated into a correlation model that assesses the QoE of Web Applications, with a consideration of defining the factors in term of quality requirements derived from web architecture. The data resulting from the mapping is used as input of the proposed model to develop artefacts that quantify and predict QoE using Machine Learning. The development of proposed model is framed and guided by Design Science Research approach with the purpose of enabling providers to more informed decisions regarding QoE and/or to optimise resources accordingly. Although the work is oriented at developing an artefact that has clear utility for practice, the nascent design theory underpinning the work is developed and discussed.},

However, under some conditions, avoiding user participation offers an alternative route to a successful implementation; this is advisable especially when the user network is weak and aligning user needs with the technological capabilities will take too much resource. To illustrate such situation, we analyse how a successful implementation outcome of an enterprise resource planning (ERP) system emerged in a recently established conglomeration of two previously independent universities. The ERP was used to replace several legacy student administration systems for both political and functional reasons. It was deemed successful by both project consultants and the new university's management while the users were marginalised (‘black boxed’) and left to ‘pick up the pieces’ of an incomplete system using traditional methods such as shadow systems and work‐a‐rounds. Using a process approach and an actor–network theory ‘reading’ of related socio‐technical events, we demonstrate how three networks of actors – management, the project team and the administrative users – collided and influenced the implementation outcome and how the management and project network established the ERP as a reliable ally while at the same time the users – while being enrolled in the network – were betrayed through marginalisation. Our analysis also suggests a useful way to conduct a ‘follow the network’ analysis explaining and accounting for the observed implementation outcome. We illustrate the benefits of using a socio‐technical processual analysis and show how stable actor networks must be constructed during large‐scale information technology change and how different actor groups perceive and influence differently the implementation outcome.},

In this paper, we argue that one reason for this is the collapse of organizational intelligence required to deal with the complexities of systems development. Organizations fail to learn from their experience in systems development because of limits of organizational intelligence, disincentives for learning, organizational designs and educational barriers. Not only have many organizations failed to learn, but they have also learned to fail. Over time they accept and expect poor performance while creating organizational myths that perpetuate short‐term optimization. This paper illustrates learning failure in systems development and recommends tactics for overcoming it.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. Information system (IS) innovation can be defined as a novel organizational application of digital computer and information communication technologies (ICT). This paper discusses how modalities of applying ICT technologies in their form and scope exhibit radical breaks, which are introduced herein as ‘disruptive IS innovations’. This notion of disruptive IS innovation is developed by drawing upon and extending Swanson's (1994) theory of IS innovation as well as the concept of radical innovation. Disruptive innovations strongly influence the future trajectory of the adoption and use of ICT in organizational contexts and make the trajectory deviate from its expected course. In doing so, these disruptive innovations distinctly define what an IS is and how it is deployed in order to address current and future organizational and managerial prerogatives. Such changes are triggered breakthroughs in the capability of ICT that lead to the revision and expansion of associated cognitive models (frames) of computing. Disruptive IS innovations are those that lead to changes in the application of ICT that are both pervasive and radical. The pervasive nature implies that innovative activity spans all innovation subsets of the quad‐core model of IS innovation introduced herein. Innovation types include: IS use and development processes; application architecture and capability; and base technologies. Radical in nature, disruptive is innovations depart in significant ways from existing alternatives and lead to deviation from expected use and diffusion trajectory. This paper demonstrates the importance of a concept of disruptive IS innovation by investigating how changes triggered by internet computing (Lyytinen et al., 1998) meet the conditions of a disruptive IS innovation defined herein. The analysis also affirms both the pervasive and radical nature of internet computing and explains how internet computing has fundamentally transformed the application portfolio, development practices and IS services over time. The analysis demonstrates that, with the concept of disruptive IS innovation, we can fruitfully analyse ‘long’ waves of ICT evolution – an issue that has largely been overlooked in the IS community. On a theoretical plane, the paper advocates the view that we need to look beyond linear, unidirectional, and atomistic concepts of the diffusion of IS innovations where innovative activity takes places in a linear fashion by oscillating between small technological innovations and small organizational innovations. In contrast, IS innovation can exhibit fundamental discontinuity; we need to theoretically grasp such disruptive moments. The recent influx of innovation, spurred by internet‐based technology, offers one such moment.},

It also opens new horizons for information systems research. We analyse how ongoing pervasive digitization of product innovation reshapes knowledge creation and sharing in innovation networks. We argue that advances in digital technologies (1) increase innovation network connectivity by reducing communication costs and increasing its reach and scope and (2) increase the speed and scope of digital convergence, which increases network knowledge heterogeneity and need for integration. These developments, in turn, stretch existing innovation networks by redistributing control and increasing the demand for knowledge coordination across time and space presenting novel challenges for knowledge creation, assimilation and integration. Based on this foundation, we distinguish four types of emerging innovation networks supported by digitalization: (1) project innovation networks; (2) clan innovation networks; (3) federated innovation networks; and (4) anarchic innovation networks. Each network involves different cognitive and social translations – or ways of identifying, sharing and assimilating knowledge. We describe the role of five novel properties of digital infrastructures in supporting each type of innovation network: representational flexibility, semantic coherence, temporal and spatial traceability, knowledge brokering and linguistic calibration. We identify several implications for future innovation research. In particular, we focus on the emergence of anarchic network forms that follow full‐fledged digital convergence founded on richer innovation ontologies and epistemologies calling to critically re‐examine the nature and impact of modularization for innovation.},

Whilst this activity proliferated across countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America from 2010 providing jobs and skills to many individuals, its growth seems to have been constrained in recent years. In order to explain this phenomenon, we undertake a longitudinal study of impact sourcing based on the case of Karnataka, which has been a prominent player in this sector since 2008. We commence by describing the operations of three impact‐sourcing enterprises in the state and locate this activity within the broader scope of state government policy focusing on two key aspects. First, we assess the adequacy of state support for rural entrepreneurs to sustain their operations for client companies and, second, whether there has been sufficient policy focus on ameliorating the socio‐economic context within which impact‐sourcing activity takes place. Finally, we reflect on important implications of our findings for further research on impact sourcing in the field of information systems and for policy prescriptions in order to create a conducive environment for this socially focused business activity to thrive.},

To date, however, there has been limited study of their use in humanitarian and particularly refugee contexts. This paper seeks to address this gap by drawing on the concept of platformisation to study the opportunities and challenges arising from UNHCR's transition from a closed transactional system to an open innovation platform focusing on core processes of identification, value creation and platform governance that are relevant for refugee management and protection. Our empirical study captures the perspectives of the UNHCR, organisational stakeholders and refugees in the world's largest refugee camp in Northern Uganda with regards to UNHCR's strategy towards platform openness. We find that UNHCR's data transformation strategy introduces the potential for increasing institutional value in the form of more effective service delivery to refugees. However, these technological opportunities do not necessarily translate to greater value if they do not mesh with current work practices, incentives and activities of service provider organisations and refugees. Our study helps identify opportunities to address these constraints, primarily through improving understanding of the emergent governance‐related tensions that exist for digital platforms for development and surfacing existing issues of exclusion and vulnerability. We conclude with insights for the broader theorisation of identification platforms and with recommendations for policies and practices that together might help realise the potential value creation introduced through the platformisation of identification systems.},

Because of this increased IT expenditure, more and more senior managers are demanding that IT play a greater role in determining their firm's success by helping them increase organizational efficiencies and perhaps even achieve competitive advantage. The existing information systems literature on IT investment and organizational strategic performance, however, provides very little help to senior managers in making before‐the‐fact IT investment decisions. The present research study puts forth some ‘hard’ evidence relating IT investment to organizational strategic and economic performance by using data envelopment analysis (DEA). Eight IT investment measures were used as inputs and 10 organizational strategic and economic performance ratios were used as outputs for the DEA model. The results indicate that two‐thirds of the organizations in this research study are deemed efficient by DEA. A clear distinction exists between the efficient group and the inefficient group in terms of IT investment and organizational strategic and economic performance. The firms in the efficient group had a much higher return on their information technology investment than the inefficient group. In addition, the DEA results pinpoint the inefficient inputs and deficient outputs for an inefficient firm allowing a senior manager to take corrective actions to compensate for the situation.},

The challenge towards e‐democracy, through the electronic transformation of political systems, has become increasingly evident within developed economies. It is regarded as an approach for increased and better quality citizen participation in the democratic processes. E‐democracy forms a component of overall e‐government initiatives where technology adoption and diffusion, to enhance wider access to, and the delivery of, government services, are apparent. However, previous research demonstrates that very few e‐democracy proposals survive the stage of formal political decision‐making to become substantive e‐government projects within national or international agendas. Furthermore, the implementation of e‐democracy projects is undertaken at a much slower pace and with dramatically less support than the implementation of other, so‐called e‐administration, activities in the public sector. The research in this paper considers the notion of the ‘middleman paradox’, presenting theoretical and empirical evidence that further investigates the phenomenon associated with potential e‐democracy improvements. Specifically, the paper adds a new dimension to existing theories on the hesitant evolution of e‐democracy that clearly identifies politicians as an inhibiting factor. Proposals are made for an enhancement of these processes, and suggestions for further applicable research are demonstrated.},

Our study focuses on control transmission in the critical relationship between client and offshore vendor managers, and its impact on the performance of IS offshoring projects. Drawing on a matched‐pair survey with 172 client and vendor managers from 86 projects, our results provide several new insights to the IS literature: First, we find that both behaviour and outcome control have the capacity to be transmitted consistently in lateral IS offshore project relationships. Second, our results show that consistent transmission translates into a performance effect only for outcome control. Third, we find that high‐performing offshore projects are characterized by both greater control transmission consistency and greater use of outcome control compared to low‐performing projects. In sum, our study extends theory on IS project control by highlighting that effective control of IS offshoring projects is not only about selecting proper controls but also about ensuring that, as a controller, you get the control across to the controllee.},

We argue that users stressed by using SNSs try to avoid the stress and develop discontinuous usage intentions, which we identify as a behavioural response to SNS‐stress creators and SNS‐exhaustion. Furthermore, as discontinuing the use of an SNS also takes effort and has costs, we theorize that switching‐stress creators and switching‐exhaustion reduce discontinuous usage intentions. We tested and validated these effects empirically in an experimental setting monitoring individuals who stopped using Facebook for a certain period and switched to alternatives. Our results show that SNS‐stress creators and SNS‐exhaustion cause discontinuous usage intentions, and switching‐stress creators and switching‐exhaustion reduce these intentions.},

Based on a 12‐month canonical action research project that took place at the Chinese branches of a French multinational corporation, our research revealed and addressed workarounds that the Chinese users of a company‐wide global enterprise resource planning system had put in place that were not expected nor desired by company headquarters. From the local users' point of view, they were necessary to deal with Chinese legislation and cultural practices, but from the French headquarters' point of view, they meant that many of the potential gains of global standards were lost. Activity theory was used as a focal theory to analyse each of these workarounds and business process management as an instrumental theory to design solutions to the workarounds. We describe in detail how we used canonical action research to successfully deal with exemplars of each of the three types of workaround identified (data adjustments, process adjustments and parallel‐system adjustments). Unusually, the research relates to post‐implementation change rather than to that looking at change occurring before and during implementation. We argue that canonical action research and the particular combination of activity theory and business process management are appropriate for dealing with workarounds and this has not been demonstrated previously. Further, our research – deemed successful by managers, users and researchers alike – took place in China where previous literature suggests only limited success with such global systems.},

Drawing on concepts from activity theory our findings provide greater theoretical understanding of workarounds in three ways. First, users are involved in collectively constructing and implementing workaround practices rather than simply being passive users or reduced to the dichotomous framing of ‘accepting’ or ‘rejecting’ an information system. Workarounds are not simple individual user improvizations but are collectively developed and become unofficial local rules. Second, workarounds are part of learning which goes beyond the view of workarounds as deviant and non‐compliant behavior. Third, learning activities are not restricted to users and their practices. Rather, as we demonstrate learning and evolution take place between the users, managers, processes and the system; that is, workarounds are not only a critical part of ‘getting work done’ but also an integral part of the institutionalization of an enterprise system.},

It contributes to recent debates on impact sourcing—understood as GITO offering social value for marginalized groups in society. Prior research to date has focused on “social mission”–driven impact sourcing initiatives, but examples of mainstream “market‐driven” GITO's engagement in impact sourcing work are largely absent in the impact sourcing literature. Using qualitative methods, this study explores the interplay between institutional logics and management practices of a market‐driven GITO organization engaged in impact sourcing work. The findings identify family, community, and profession logics existing in the subsidiary location and management practices of the GITO organization responding to these logics. We abstract the practices into three mechanisms (ie, synchronization, bridging, and embedding) and present a process model that explains the dynamics of institutional logics and institutionally aligned management practices. This study offers both theoretical and practical implications to understand the implementation of impact sourcing initiatives in market‐driven GITO scenarios.},

Building on consumer value theory, we empirically examine the differences between basic and premium users in terms of the emotional, functional, social, epistemic, and economic values driving basic users' decisions to upgrade to premium subscriptions and premium users' decisions to retain their paid subscriptions. We employ enjoyment, intrusiveness of advertising in the free subscription, ubiquity, social connectivity, the discovery of new content, and the price value of the premium subscription as drivers of intentions and test our model using data from a leading digital content service that employs the freemium model. Our results show that enjoyment and price value of the premium subscription predict the intention to upgrade to premium, whereas the intention to retain the premium subscription is driven by ubiquity and the discovery of new content. Interestingly, social connectivity has no effect on the intention to upgrade but does have a small negative effect on the intention to retain the premium subscription. Contrary to our expectations, intrusiveness of advertising in the free subscription had a negative effect on the price value of the premium subscription. Collectively, our results imply that the intention to retain the premium subscription is influenced by attribute‐level value perceptions such as ubiquity, the discovery of new content, and social connectivity whereas the intention to upgrade is driven by benefits, ie, enjoyment and price value of the premium subscription.},

It examines several relevant theoretical perspectives, including theories of discourse comprehension, contextualized learning and the production paradox, and reports on an exploratory study in the knowledge‐based systems (KBS) domain. Process‐tracing data was collected using a ‘thinking‐aloud’ procedure, and data analysis focused on some highly illustrative verbal protocols. Results indicate that contextualized access to domain knowledge can be critical for understanding KBS output, and that lack of it can cause comprehension difficulties. Contextualized access is highly effective for resolving comprehension difficulties arising from the users' lack of task domain knowledge and for reducing the motivational ‘cost’ of learning. We conclude that it has the potential for substantially increasing the effectiveness of information systems.},

Stimulated by this neglect and our personal experiences, we aim to raise awareness and understanding about the ethics of planning, conducting and reporting AR. We identify and discuss four issues of concern that merit specific ethical attention when conducting AR: collaboration, competence, persistence and consent. We draw on these four issues in an analysis that augments the principles and criteria for canonical AR (CAR), recently reified as Integrated Action Research (IAR). Our guidance includes an additional principle of AR and 10 associated criteria to address the ethics of AR participation.},

Weaknesses relate to a predominant focus on an organizational level of analysis and a lack of power considerations. In this paper we aim to build on these strengths and to ameliorate these weaknesses by proposing a comprehensive IS strategizing framework that uses extant IS strategizing research as a foundation, rejuvenated by insights from the emerging strategy‐as‐practice literature.

A theory is developed to explain how the lack of dependable rules encourages guanxi and relationship‐based commerce. It suggests that personal trust, contextual and informal information, and blurred boundaries between business and government have shaped e‐commerce in mainland China. Case studies of online retailers in Beijing and Shanghai and a business‐to‐business (B2B) marketspace reveal how dynamic business relationships with complementary service providers and state agents can overcome institutional deficiencies. Short message service (SMS)‐based mobile commerce (m‐commerce) and other leapfrogging information technology (IT) applications could transform Chinese consumer behaviour and improve economic efficiency. The evidence from China helps to explain the influence of culture and institutions on different types of IT applications.

Systems development research shows that practitioners seldom follow methods and that the competencies required for successful development of computer‐based systems go well beyond those represented in contemporary methods. These insights make us question the role that methods should play in educating would‐be developers. Pedagogical theories, such as situated learning and double‐loop learning, complement these insights. Integrating the two, we argue that students need to complement the simplified accounts that methods express, with reflections on methods‐in‐use and on development practice in general. We present operationalizations of this idea in two quite different academic settings. Based on a retrospective analysis of our experiences in these settings, and a comparison and evaluation of the two approaches, we propose a number of lessons that can be used to improve the education of would‐be developers.},

One promising approach to understanding CASE introduction better and to managing it more effectively has been developed by relating CASE introduction to the Capability Maturity Model (CMM). This paper reviews software process maturity as a framework for CASE introduction. The relevance of the framework is discussed and three critical questions are explored: 1) What is the role of organizational experiments in CASE introduction? 2) How do the functional characteristics of CASE technology influence CASE introduction? and 3) How does the organizational context influence CASE introduction? The aim of the paper, by way of this discussion, is to explicate the strengths and limits of software process maturity as a framework for CASE introduction, and to identify the most important supplementary issues},

In this paper, we develop a framework that can be utilized as a language for articulating and theorizing the ITA in IS research. Our framework builds on the multi‐faceted theoretical paradigm of systems thinking from which we derive several concepts and appropriate them to the context at hand, resulting in a seven‐dimensional framework of characteristics for ITAs. In a literature survey of research on enterprise systems and enterprise resource planning systems in top IS journals, we show how ITA characteristics are currently included to present details of the relevant ITA instance and identify theoretical relationships between ITA characteristics and outcomes. We conclude the study by demonstrating the use of the ITA framework for delineating and theorizing the ITA in IS research.},

Drawing on the IS literature and Information and Communication Technologies for Development (ICT4D) scholarship, we extrapolate five areas of research that can better illuminate fintech's contributions to financial inclusion: (a) business strategies for fintech‐led financial inclusion; (b) digital artifacts of fintech‐led financial inclusion; (c) business environment of fintech‐led financial inclusion; (d) microfoundations of fintech for financial inclusion; (e) developmental impacts of fintech.

At its core, the mindfulness theoretical concept promotes a focus on ‘continuous attention to detail’ and ‘vigilance to minimise errors and respond effectively to unexpected events’. Incorporating a sixteen month ongoing longitudinal case study of an ISD organisation, this research provides an insight into the practice of what we term ‘doing’ agile and ‘being’ agile, while also providing a number of theoretical contributions around the value of mindfulness for ISD agility.},

This absence of operational‐level detailing can trigger status‐led enactments of power. Drawing on a qualitative case study of a distributed finance function in a global logistics firm, this paper explores how high‐status business units (BU) frame their task migration actions and contrasts it with how a low‐status support unit frames and accounts for the actions of high‐status BUs. The findings show how high‐status BUs frame their own actions as protecting, supporting and monitoring the migrated tasks while the low‐status support unit frames the same set of actions as resisting, interfering and hypercriticizing. Theoretically, the paper suggests that during the implementation of task migration strategies, frames deployed by a low‐status unit considers its weaker position of power and serves to neutralise conflict with the more powerful, higher‐status unit.},

Concepts from chaos theory have recently been applied as a model for interpreting organizational change and understanding organizational behaviour. This paper applies these concepts to the study of information systems in organizations. Key concepts from chaos theory are identified and used to develop an interpretive framework. The importance of understanding the initial conditions when an information systems strategy is developed or an information system is implemented is highlighted. The idea of strange attractors, patterns of behaviours of information systems, organizations and actors, which are repeated is developed, and the effect of internal and external events and choices is considered. These chaos theory concepts are applied to a case study of information systems strategy implementation in the UK probation service. It is concluded that concepts from chaos theory offer valuable support in developing a coherent and meaningful story concerning interactions between information systems and their host organizations.},

For more than 30 years, critical research in information systems (IS) has challenged the assumption that technology innovation is inherently desirable and hence to the benefit of all. Nevertheless, how researchers view the nature of being critical has changed over time, and so too have the ways that they pursue their critical agenda and argue for their contributions. In this paper, I present a brief historical account of critical IS research, tracing the theoretical perspectives that have been dominant at different times and the empirical efforts that were guided by them. As part of tracing our current position I examine two key texts authored by Chrisanthi Avgerou and Geoff Walsham, who pursue different types of critical agenda and make distinctive empirically based contributions concerning the substantive issue of global diversity in IS innovation and its consequences. Overall, I suggest that the IS field now accepts broad definitions of the nature of being critical, but despite having a body of empirical critical research from which to learn, we are not making the most of our opportunities to do so, which retards further development. While I do not seek to develop a prescription for conducting and evaluating critical research, or try to encourage lengthy confessional accounts of research conduct in all journal papers, I do argue that we need more explicit reflections about our sustained long‐term efforts in the field. Such reflections might consider the way we develop our critical arguments and insights, and what we strive for and accomplish through our interventions. In effect, the IS field has not yet reached a position where the theory and practice of doing critical research are informing each other.},

Information technology (IT) innovation research examines the organizational and technological factors that determine IT adoption and diffusion, including firm size and scope, technological competency and expected benefits. We extend the literature by focusing on information requirements as a driver of IT innovation adoption and diffusion. Our framework of IT innovation diffusion incorporates three industry‐level sources of information requirements: process complexity, clock speed and supply chain complexity. We apply the framework to US manufacturing industries using aggregate data of internet‐based innovations and qualitative analysis of two industries: wood products and beverage manufacturing. Results show systematic patterns supporting the basic thesis of the information processing paradigm: higher IT innovation diffusion in industries with higher information processing requirements; the salience of downstream industry structure in the adoption of interorganizational systems; and the role of the location of information intensity in the supply chain in determining IT adoption and diffusion. Our study provides a new explanation for why certain industries were early and deep adopters of internet‐based innovations while others were not: variation in information processing requirements.},

Using theories of technology acceptance and technology transfer, we identified factors affecting the use of mobile information and communication technology (mobile ICT) in the least developed countries (LDCs), specifically sub‐Saharan Africa. From a literature review, we developed a research model to describe factors that impact mobile ICT use and formulated a series of hypotheses about them. We then surveyed mobile ICT users in Kenya and Nigeria and created a structural model to examine our hypothesized relationships. Our findings indicate that access to mobile ICT, and cultural influences on mobile ICT diffusion, strongly influence individuals’ perceptions of the usefulness and ease of use of mobile ICT. Individuals’ perceptions about the reliability of mobile ICT influence use of these technologies significantly. The results suggest that, although extensive ICT diffusion (high mobile ICT levels per capita) may be necessary for seeding commercial and economic initiatives that depend heavily on mobile ICT, such as m‐commerce, it may not be sufficient. Firms conducting business in sub‐Saharan Africa need to pay attention to the factors that explain individual mobile ICT use because these factors will most likely determine the optimal market segmentation, business development and customer service strategies for leveraging m‐commerce operations in that region. For government units, the understanding of such factors would also be beneficial in aiding economic planning and commerce.},

While most of the literature is still focusing on the exposition of the unbound potential of PSN, this paper seeks to clarify the question of how to capture and manage the professional identity of an industry such that PSN can be purposefully anchored in the working context. Following an Action Design Research approach, we describe practical design propositions and possible tensions along the contextualization of a PSN, which was specifically catered for improving interprofessional and interorganizational collaboration in and between hospitals. We identify several implications for future research.

Several studies have reported positive effects from using such “physiolytics” devices and purported the notion that it may lead to significant workplace safety improvements or to increased awareness among employees concerning unhealthy work practices and other job‐related health and well‐being issues. At the same time, physiolytics may cause an overdependency on technology and create new constraints on privacy, individuality, and personal freedom. While it is easy to understand why organizations are implementing physiolytics, it remains unclear what employees think about using wearables at their workplace. Using an affordance theory lens, we, therefore, explore the mental models of employees who are faced with the introduction of physiolytics as part of corporate wellness or security programs. We identify five distinct user types each of which characterizes a specific viewpoint on physiolytics at the workplace: the freedom loving, the individualist, the cynical, the tech independent, and the balancer. Our findings allow for better understanding the wider implications and possible user responses to the introduction of wearable technologies in occupational settings and address the need for opening up the “user black box” in IS use research.},

Groups of actors changed to become more heterogeneous and ‘fluid’ in the deployment and implementation phases, thus forming ‘webs of developers’ and ‘webs of users’. Detailed analysis of the process in its entirety shows the blurredness of boundaries between ‘developer’ and ‘user’ categories and roles, and reveals challenges at social and organizational levels. Three models pertaining to the system development process are presented in order to illuminate differing perspectives on the user and on the development process itself.

It is particularly concerned with the semantic and pragmatic dimensions of information, and integrates the work of Maturana and Habermas into a framework provided by Dretske's theory of semantic information. The results show that meaning is generated from the information carried by signs. Information is objective, but inaccessible to humans, who exist exclusively in a world of meaning. Meaning is intersubjective — that is, based on shared agreement and understanding — rather than purely subjective. Information, and information processing systems, exist within the wider context of meaning or sense‐making and the IS discipline needs take account of this.},

The first theory suggests that greater autonomy leads to greater perceptions of fair treatment, and the second suggests that perceptions of fair treatment lead to greater commitment and performance. A postal survey of 130 chief information officers of the US subsidiaries of multinational firms collected data to test hypotheses based on the theory. Data analysis using partial least squares tested a high‐level model and a decomposed model. The high‐level model revealed that a second order strategic systems planning (SSP) autonomy construct predicted the perceptions of procedural justice, procedural justice predicted a second order SSP construct, and the SSP construct predicted SSP effectiveness. The decomposed model showed that autonomy in the especially creative strategy conception phase of planning predicted procedural justice. Procedural justice predicted all of the phases of SSP, while the strategy selection phase alone led to planning effectiveness. These findings underscore the impact of the autonomy to be creative and of the sense of fair treatment, both within the context of limited autonomy for the choice of the strategy. They highlight the impact of the choice of the strategy in contrast to other planning phases, and perhaps most importantly, they argue for local control of the planning process.},

Drawing on cognitive learning theory, the cognitive theory of multimedia learning and the literature on deep processing, we develop our research model, which is based on the model by Jiang and Benbasat (2007). We test our model in experimental settings with 269 research‐oriented students and academics who were randomised into four conditions: (1) reading a text‐based article, (2) reading the script for a video about the article, (3) viewing the video story of the article, and (4) viewing the video story followed by reading the article. Results showed that the article's script was significantly perceived to be the least useful in disseminating research content. The video story and text‐based article were perceived to be equally useful, and supplementing the text‐based article with a video story was perceived to be the most useful. Moreover, the video story and text‐based article supplemented by a video story were of roughly equal effectiveness; yet, the video script was the most effective, and the text‐based article was least effective relative to other formats in disseminating scholarly knowledge. Last, we discuss how to further improve the design of video stories by referring to the critical narrative theory, which has the potential to significantly promote the dissemination of IS scholarly knowledge.},

In particular, trust matters more in high‐dimensionality sharing encounters—those encounters that have a longer duration, require a greater financial investment, involve more social interaction, etc. Further, it is important to note that all sharing encounters take place through two‐sided intermediary platforms, and we find that the role of trust among the different types of sharing partners is not symmetrical across the two sides. Trust in the intermediary platform matters more to customers than to service providers in their willingness to engage in service encounters. Overall, this research contributes to existing literature by developing the notion of a service encounter and associated dimensionality and by demonstrating that service encounter dimensionality affects the importance of trust in the sharing economy. Also, we show how trust matters differently for different sides of two‐sided sharing platforms.

However, there appears to be marked shift in the relationship between the citizen and the state moving from government being responsive to the needs of citizens to viewing citizens explicitly as customers. This paper argues that this change is being accelerated by government use of techniques like benchmarking, which have been widely used in the private sector. To illustrate this point, the paper focuses on the adoption of website benchmarking techniques by the public sector. The paper argues that the essence of these benchmarking technologies, a process comprised of both finding and producing truth, is fundamentally based on the act of classifying and draws on Martin Heidegger's etymological enquiry to reinterpret classification as a dynamic movement towards order that both creates and obfuscates truth. In so doing, it demonstrates how Heidegger's seminal ideas can be adapted for critical social research by showing that technology is more than an instrument as it has epistemic implications for what counts as truth. This stance is used as the basis for understanding empirical work reporting on a UK government website benchmarking project. Our analysis identifies the means involved in producing the classifications inherent in such benchmarking projects and relates these to the more general move that is recasting the relationship between the citizen and the state, and increasingly blurring the boundaries between the state and the private sector. Recent developments in other attempts by the UK government to use private‐sector technologies and approaches indicate ways in which this move might be challenged.},

   abstract                      = {Large enterprise resource planning (ERP) programs and their critical success factors (CSFs) have been subject to intensive research in recent years. One of the key challenges is their complexity in terms of their duration, context, and social dynamics. The aim of this study is to investigate these matters with the help of an interpretative case study using the coding techniques of the grounded theory method. We extend extant ERP research by introducing a new theoretical perspective that helps to clarify how stakeholder perceptions and CSFs are interrelated, and evolve throughout the life cycle of a large ERP implementation conceptualized as a program in a postmerger context. Using Social Identity Theory as a metatheory for interpretation, we find that different perceptions of opposing salient groups are particularly important. Our result offers a dialectic process view of ERP program implementation success, which (1) considers the different perceptions of salient groups (2) at different points in time (phases) and (3) proposes that a low perceptual fit in relation to a specific CSF contributes to program failure as opposed to (4) a high perceptual fit in relation to the respective CSF, which contributes to program success. We offer a new theoretical lens and propositions for future work highlighting the importance of salient groups and their CSF perceptions for ERP program success. Practitioners can use our findings as a guide towards increasing the probability of success throughout the course of their ERP program life cycles.},

These problems showed up in the manufacturing plants but originated in the sales offices. They caused difficulties with customers and increased manufacturing and selling costs. The company decided that an expert system could solve the problem. The processes associated with the design of this successful system created as many human as technical challenges. The paper describes these, discusses how and why they originated, and evaluates Digital's strategies for solving them.

This paper traces the history of socio‐technical design, emphasizing the set of values it embraces, the people espousing its theory and the organizations that practise it. Its role in the implementation of computer systems and its impact in a number of different countries are stressed. It also shows its relationship with action research, as a humanistic set of principles aimed at increasing human knowledge while improving practice in work situations. Its evolution in the 1960s and 1970s evidencing improved working practices and joint agreements between workers and management are contrasted with the much harsher economic climate of the 1980s and 1990s when such principled practices, with one or two notable exceptions, gave way to lean production, downsizing and cost cutting in a global economy, partly reflecting the impact of information and communications technology. Different future scenarios are discussed where socio‐technical principles might return in a different guise to humanize the potential impact of technology in a world of work where consistent organizational and economic change are the norm.},

The development, implementation and ownership of information systems, especially large‐scale systems such as enterprise resource planning (ERP), has become progressively longer in duration and more cost intensive. As a result, IS managers are being required to justify projects financially based on their return. Historically, information systems have been difficult to quantify in monetary terms because of the intangible nature of many of the derived benefits, e.g. improved customer service. Using the case study methodology, this paper examines an attempt by a large computer manufacturer to incorporate intangibles into traditional cost–benefit analysis in an ERP project. The paper reviews the importance of intangibles, lists intangible benefits that are important in ERP projects and demonstrates the use of a scheme through which they can be incorporated into traditional evaluation techniques.},

The existing research focuses primarily on the contextual antecedents and performance effects of control‐mode choices but largely neglects the dynamics of control activities, and particularly the socio‐emotional aspects of such activities. We conducted longitudinal fieldwork to evaluate the dynamic interplay between control activities and emotions in the context of a large‐scale, health care IS project. Our case analysis provides empirical evidence for the link between controllers' control styles and controllees' emotions and subsequent behaviours. For instance, our analysis results point to “suppressed” effects of negative emotions on control effectiveness. We find that while controllees' negative emotional appraisals of control activities do not necessarily translate into immediate resistance behaviours, they can give rise to delayed resistance behaviours triggered by shifting control styles.},

The growing interest in interpretive information systems research has drawn attention to the need to gain access to the interpretations of social actors. Various data‐gathering methods are available to the researcher to achieve such access. These may be seen as located on a spectrum in terms of the degree of engagement between the researcher and the research subject. While engagement is not without its drawbacks from a research perspective, it may be argued that it enables good access to the sorts of data that interpretive researchers are seeking. Most of the research reported in the information systems (IS) field, however, has adopted relatively distant methods by which the researcher avoids intervention in the research context. Some of the characteristics of more engaged forms of research are illustrated through a discussion of a participant observation study of executive information systems development. This research has highlighted a number of issues that can be seen to be common to other data‐gathering methods. Reasons for the neglect of engaged data‐gathering methods are explored, and it is suggested that consideration of the issues it raises may contribute to more reflexive interpretive IS research practice.},

This study addressed this gap by asking 19 practicing IT PMs to describe the skills that successful IT PMs exhibit. A semi‐structured interview method known as the repertory grid (RepGrid) technique was used to elicit these skills. Nine skill categories emerged: client management, communication, general management, leadership, personal integrity, planning and control, problem solving, systems development and team development. Our study complements existing research by providing a richer understanding of several skills that were narrowly defined (client management, planning and control, and problem solving) and by introducing two new skill categories that had not been previously discussed (personal integrity and team development). Analysis of the individual RepGrids revealed four distinct ways in which study participants combined skill categories to form archetypes of effective IT PMs. We describe these four IT PM archetypes – General Manager, Problem Solver, Client Representative and Balanced Manager – and discuss how this knowledge can be useful for practitioners, researchers and educators.

We use the dynamic capabilities framework to argue that building a dynamic project learning capability is useful for organizations that make extensive use of projects. We use both survey and interview data to discuss the key ways in which such a dynamic capability can be built. Our survey data demonstrate the importance of documenting project learning, but our interview data show that teams are often remiss at documenting their learning. The results from the two different approaches are synthesized using Boland & Tenkasi’s notions of perspective‐making and perspective‐taking. Importantly, combining the results from the two sets of data suggests that organizations need to emphasize the benefits from project reviews and documentation and explore ways in which the documents produced can be made more useful as boundary objects to encourage the sharing of learning across projects.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. This paper presents a knowledge‐focused perspective for the development of a model to explain the diffusion and adoption of complex integrating technologies. Business process re‐engineering (BPR) is used as the example to illustrate the model. However, while BPR is used to illustrate our argument, the model that is developed is relevant to understanding the innovation processes surrounding any complex IT‐based innovation. It is argued that the strength of this diffusion model is that it focuses not on the spread of particular technological artifacts (whether it is BPR or any other IT‐based innovation), but on the spread of the ideas and knowledge underpinning the technology. In particular, the model draws attention to the ways in which technology suppliers commodify knowledge and present ‘packaged’ solutions. This creates problems for potential users who need to unpack this knowledge and integrate it with existing organizational knowledge. The diffusion and adoption of innovations is thus seen as a process of integrating knowledge across disparate communities. Such knowledge integration, however, is difficult. This can help to explain the apparent contradiction between the limited success rate of BPR and its widespread diffusion among western firms.},

   abstract                      = {Despite the seeming ubiquity of young people's Internet use, there are still many for whom access to the Internet and online social networking remains inequitable and patterned by disadvantage. The connection between information technology and young people with disabilities is particularly under‐researched. This article contributes to the field of critical information systems research by exposing significant barriers and facilitators to Internet accessibility for young people with disabilities. It uses Bourdieu's critical theory to explore how the unequal distribution of resources shapes processes of digital inclusion for young people with disabilities. It highlights access needs and experiences that are both disability and non‐disability related. The article draws on interviews in South Australia with 18 young people aged 10–18 years with a physical disability (such as cerebral palsy) or acquired brain injury and with 17 of their family members. Interviews evaluated participants' and parents' reflections on the benefits of a home‐based, goal‐oriented intervention to increase the young person's Internet use for social participation purposes. The Bourdieuian analysis demonstrated how varying levels of accrued individual and family offline capital resources are related to digital/online resources and disability‐specific online resources. This revealed how unequal resources of capital can influence technology use and hence digital inclusion for young people with disabilities. Our study demonstrates that young people with particular types of disabilities require intensive, personalised and long‐term support from within and beyond the family to ‘get online’. We conclude that Internet studies need to more frequently adopt critical approaches to investigate the needs of users and barriers to information technology use within sub‐groups, such as young people with disabilities. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

Using an innovative process model, we describe and analyse the process of introducing enterprise resource planning (ERP) systems in two Chinese small and medium‐sized enterprises and especially their decisions concerning business process re‐engineering. First we compared the results from our cases with Martinsons' earlier work (2004). One case seemed to fit most of the characteristics of a private venture (PV) whereas the other case, also a PV, had a very low degree of fit. We used the process model to offer further insights and features such as its predictive power. Second, and as predicted, we also observed the differential role of top management support in the two Chinese companies. But thirdly, and somewhat surprisingly, we found that cultural issues were only of limited importance. Finally, the ability of the project team to deal with unexpected events was seen as critical in ensuring the stability of a project. In contrast, project drift is shown to lead to a degree of chaos. We offer some suggestions as to how stakeholders can improve their chances of implementing ERP systems more successfully.},

However, the vast majority of crowdsourcing research has focussed on crowdsourced system components broadly and understanding individuals' motivation in contributing to crowdsourced systems. Little research has examined the features of crowdsourced systems that influence whether individuals utilise this information, particularly in the context of warnings for phishing emails. Thus, the present study examined four features related to warnings derived from a mock crowdsourced anti‐phishing warning system that 438 participants were provided to aid in their evaluation of a series of email messages: the number of times an email message was reported as being potentially suspicious, the source of the reports, the accuracy rate of the warnings (based on reports) and the disclosure of the accuracy rate. The results showed that crowdsourcing features work together to encourage warning acceptance and reduce anxiety. Accuracy rate demonstrated the most prominent effects on outcomes related to judgement accuracy, adherence to warning recommendations and anxiety with system use. The results are discussed regarding implications for organisations considering the design and implementation of crowdsourced phishing warning systems that facilitate accurate recommendations.},

Graphic data models are commonly used as a tool for presentation of information structures in the design, implementation, use and maintenance of the databases that support information systems. The methods proposed for database design assume that the use of graphic data models will enhance understanding of system specifications by both the end‐users and the implementers of the system. For this assumption to hold, the information presented in the graphic data model must be readily comprehensible so that the design, represented by the model, can be confirmed and implemented correctly. The lack of standard representations for graphic models has led to a variety of graphic styles. To date, there has been little focus on studying the effect graphic style has on model comprehension. We have studied the effect of three graphic styles proposed for data models on model legibility and interpretation. Our study shows a significant variation in model interpretation that can be attributed to the graphic syntax used. Graphic style appears to influence which model elements are included in the interpretation, as well as the way data models are read.},

We have developed an approach to enable systems developers to use a richer view of organizations and a more interpretive approach. Multi‐Metaphor Method (MMM) supports developers via a range of metaphors as cognitive structuring devices to understand an organization so that developers can learn to move between different ways of ‘reading’ the social context in which ISD occurs. We explain the rationale and theoretical underpinnings of MMM and then discuss our action research to investigate the viability and relevance of MMM during ISD practice. We show how the developers’ use of organizational metaphors via MMM did not just enable rich conceptualizations of the client organizations but also influenced the ISD process and final product.

Throughout its history, the issue of risk has been closely related to ISD projects, and significant efforts have been made by researchers and practitioners to improve their quality. While important headway has been made in assessing and resolving ISD risk, the literature shows that new and salient risks emerge outside the scope of extant risk management regimes. As a consequence, organizations still struggle with leveraging new technology as projects continue to fail at almost the same rate, albeit for different reasons. Understood as the distinction between reality and possibility, risk is inherently intertwined with practice and rooted in the knowledge, goals, power, and values of specific actors in particular contexts. Hence, to understand how risks emerge, we present a longitudinal case study in which we trace the origin and locus of risks in contemporary ISD practices. We draw on these insights to theorize information technology risk as increasingly interstitial, originating from sources positioned in between established practices and therefore outside the scope of conventional risk analyses. In conclusion, we discuss interstitial risks as an important form of emergent risk with implications for both research and practice.},

   abstract                      = {Given its personal and ubiquitous nature, the smartwatch can easily become infused into individuals’ daily lives, social roles, and relationships. This type of intertwinement of an information technology (IT) in the daily lives of individuals creates an IT identity. To understand this phenomenon in the personal IT context, this research draws from the IT identity and valence frameworks to examine how benefits and risks of smartwatch use affect deep use and innovative individual performance through smartwatch identity. Specifically, we examine how social interactions and belongingness (i.e., benefits) and privacy risk (i.e., risk) influence the building of the smartwatch identity, and in turn both deep use and innovative individual performance. Further, we explore the mediating influence of smartwatch identity. Using a survey, we collected data from 216 smartwatch users. The analysis provides evidence for the IT identity to deep use link and IT identity to innovative individual performance link. This work contributes to the IT identity literature by examining and showing how both positive and negative aspects of the smartwatch influence identity construction. This work also demonstrates the relationships between IT identity and performance, and deep use and performance. For practice, we offer insights for enhancing identity and performance.},

This paper makes two significant contributions. To conduct this evaluation, the researchers operationalised the Klein & Myers seven principles for interpretive study for the first time, creating a set of questions that other IS researchers can now use to evaluate their own interpretive studies. The paper also applies these to the design of the focus groups and develops a set of recommendations for future IS researchers to consider based on lessons learned in this study.},

This prior research has shown that how we adopt and use an information system depends on how we make sense of it. The sense‐making activity is carried out through our cognitive structures of knowledge that relate to technology (our technological frames). The sense‐making activity changes over time, as use and exposure to differing technologies occur. Most research into information systems in organisations has focused on a specific information system; this preoccupation with studying discrete projects at one point in time may be limiting. In an attempt to fill this research gap, we use the socio‐cognitive perspective of Orlikowski & Gash to analyse technological frames in one organisation over a longitudinal period to evaluate sensemaking in relation to multiple systems. The interpretive case study looks at the technological frames of senior management, faculty teaching staff, information technology (IT) mediating staff and IT groups over a 10‐year period in a university and finds that there were incongruent frames between senior management and other groups within the organisation with senior management holding a dominant frame. The consequences of these frames were demonstrated when they were linked to the use of the four major information systems in the organisation, showing repeated historical patterns of use that caused inefficiencies due to the incongruent frames of the various groups. The unchanging dominant technological frame contributed to this pattern.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. Niche companies are per definition idiosyncratic. They survive in a competitive world by mastering a small market niche, providing what their customers need. This often requires a flexible organization, and the ability to customize products. To be more efficient, many of these companies rely on extensive use of IT, often by installing general Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems. These systems have grown from isolated systems that handle planning based on incoming orders and the component structure of the various products, to systems with ambitions to embrace the total functioning of the company including vendor and customer relation management. In this paper, we present four case studies. One company is a part of a large enterprise, but performs niche functions within this enterprise. The other three are small‐ or medium‐sized enterprises. Each of these performs in small niche markets. Common to all is the fact that they encounter problems with the utilization of their ERP systems. The major problem seems to be that the ERP system has an inherent business model that may not conform to the needs of the company. Without a good understanding of the underlying models and the constraints under which the fundamental algorithms operate, it is difficult to use these systems correctly. Even excellent systems may give bad results if they are applied to situations where they are not suited. Further, the monolithic structure of an ERP system, with a rather complicated parameter setting, is often insufficient to mould the system to the needs of a niche company. We discuss these problems based on our four case studies, and offer alternative approaches that may be considered.},

The cost of ERP implementation failures is exceedingly high in terms of quantifiable financial resources and organizational disruption. The lack of good explanatory and predictive models makes it difficult for managers to develop and plan ERP implementation projects with any assurance of success. In this paper we investigate the Klein & Sorra theoretical model of implementation effectiveness. To test this model we develop and validate a data collection instrument to capture the appropriate data, and then use multivariate adaptive regression splines to examine the assertions of the model and suggest additional significant relationships among the factors of their model. Our research offers new dimensions for studying managerial interventions in IT implementation and insights into factors that can be managed to improve the effectiveness of ERP implementation projects.},

While the information systems literature has recently acknowledged the role transactive memory plays in improving knowledge processes and performance in colocated teams, little is known about its contribution to distributed teams. To contribute to filling this gap, knowledge‐transfer challenges and processes between onsite and offshore teams were studied at TATA Consultancy Services. In particular, the paper describes the transfer of knowledge between onsite and offshore teams through encoding, storing and retrieving processes. An in‐depth case study of globally distributed software development projects was carried out, and a qualitative, interpretive approach was adopted. The analysis of the case suggests that in order to overcome differences derived from the local contexts of the onsite and offshore teams (e.g. different work routines, methodologies and skills), some specific mechanisms supporting the development of codified and personalized ‘directories’ were introduced. These include the standardization of templates and methodologies across the remote sites as well as frequent teleconferencing sessions and occasional short visits. These mechanisms contributed to the development of the notion of ‘who knows what’ across onsite and offshore teams despite the challenges associated with globally distributed teams, and supported the transfer of knowledge between onsite and offshore teams. The paper concludes by offering theoretical and practical implications.},

The results of a study of 172 public e‐commerce investment announcements show that resolution of external (exogenous) and internal (endogenous) uncertainty has a significant effect on option exercise decisions. However, the results also imply that simply waiting without investment in active learning does not create significant value from real options. The key differentiator is how a firm resolves endogenous uncertainty as this endows it with the ability to successfully undertake the information technology investment and exploit the economic opportunity implied by the resolution of exogenous uncertainty. Furthermore, our results imply that different options should be used to manage situations involving certainty of loss on one hand and severity of loss on the other hand. Thus, it is important for firms to make the right choices when using options‐based investing to manage risk. We suggest that, perhaps, managers need to maintain a portfolio of options to manage the two dimensions of risk simultaneously.},

On one side are those who take the position that these methods are not used at all. The other side posits that SDMs are used but not in the manner intended by the method developers. In practice, SDMs are adapted and modified to meet project exigencies, which results in unique methods‐in‐use in each project. We subscribe to the latter view and extend the argument by proposing that SDM modifications happen due to mismatches between the paradigmatic values inherent in the SDM, the method users and the organizational context. Further, planned modifications themselves result in shifts of paradigmatic values inherent in the SDM. To examine our contention, we conduct a case study in which we trace an SDM from its development to its deployment and use in an organization. We show where the mismatches occurred and provide explanations for the mismatches. Our results indicate that paradigm differences explain most of the mismatches, and different factors contribute to the paradigm drifts simultaneously, even towards diverging orientations. We conclude that the true value of an SDM, in addition to its tool and technique use, is a basis for examining and self‐reflecting about paradigmatic values.

This paper presents a commitment transformation framework for analysing the change in actors’ commitment during the transition from escalation to de‐escalation in information technology projects. De‐escalation is potentially a more important issue than escalation because de‐escalation provides remedies for the ills of escalation. Therefore, it is important to understand how stakeholders may bias facts in the direction of previously accepted beliefs and thus prevent an organization from de‐escalating. Here, we adopt Lewin's change theory to examine the commitment transformation during the transition from escalation to de‐escalation of an e‐government project in a local council in the United Kingdom. By conceiving actors’ commitment transformation as an ‘unfreezing–changing–refreezing’ process, researchers may develop a deeper understanding of how actors may give up previous failing course of action and accept an alternative course of action. Practitioners can also utilize the framework in post‐mortem analyses of projects which have faced escalation to devise useful de‐escalation strategies for future project development.<jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="#fn1"> 1 </jats:ext-link>},

There has been a drive to better understand and observe the practical and societal impact of research, led by researchers seeking to find meaning and purpose in their work, as well as government agencies responsible for allocating research funding to maximum effect. Despite a wealth of guidance from researchers discussing impact and agencies evaluating impact, making practice impact visible and demonstrable remains arduous to researchers because it appears to be possible only at the end of a long and winding pathway to impact. This article presents a framework for demonstrating practice impact as it is being realized progressively, rather than only at the end of the pathway. It identifies usable , in‐use , and useful research outputs, with each having cumulative and demonstrable practice impact. Our analyses of existing impact evaluation guidelines and top‐ranked impact cases submitted to the Research Excellence Framework 2014 showed that all three forms of impact can be demonstrated and are recognized as practice impact. Framing impact in terms of “use” inherently connects the perspectives of researchers and beneficiary users and positions users as co‐producers of impact rather than passive objects and recipients of research. The 3U framework is descriptive as well as prescriptive. It identifies impact indicators for each form of impact. It also indicates the necessary actions for strengthening impact.

The longitudinal nature of the case study offered opportunities for in‐depth investigation of participants' experience and development during the process. Using this datum, a mid‐level analytical approach is adopted. It is found that learning about the path to return to IT emerged regardless of the degree of participation in the intervention programme, and this was supported by the diversity and integration embedded in this programme.

Based on a survey of 301 online auction participants, we demonstrate that both trait impulsiveness as an emotional trigger and sunk cost as a cognitive trigger promote winner's regret. By grounding our research model in the automatic thinking view, we provide an alternative meta‐theoretical lens from which to view online bidder behaviour, thus bolstering our current understanding of winner's regret. We also investigate the moderating effects of competition intensity on the relationships between the triggers of automatic thinking and winner's regret. Our results show that both trait impulsiveness and sunk cost have significant impacts on winner's regret. We also found that the relationship between these two triggers and winner's regret is moderated by competition intensity.},

Social media and online content provide mechanisms to engage specific populations while helping to reduce barriers that can often hinder participation and engagement. Using action research and informed by co‐creation theory, the MyHealthImpactNetwork.org initiative seeks to provide a user experience targeting Black female college students. Data were collected from females at a large university located in the Southeast United States. Through focus group participants' feedback, co‐creation with students as design delegates and reviews of social media resentments, MyHealthImpactNetwork.org evolved to include user‐driven content. Results indicate that Black females are interested in HIV prevention information that uses simple, non‐technical health jargon. The information should be, however, socially engaging to enable their voices to be heard, absent of cultural assumptions and biases about Black women, and embody an ownership ethos relative to social content. Informed by principals of canonical action research and the co‐creation that results between the researcher and potential user, these findings suggest that the hedonic dimension underpins the key design lessons. This research helps to fill a void in the literature regarding the creation of user experiences for health‐related messages, particularly those regarding stigmatized conditions, such as HIV, while designing for cultures of participation among under‐represented groups.},

This paper addresses this question, reporting on an analysis of articles published in leading academic and practitioner journals. It describes how the IS organization is portrayed in these studies and examines the results of this analysis through a sensitizing lens constructed from research that has studied how organizations generate business value from IS. The lens depicts this objective as a quest to harness knowledge that is distributed enterprise wide. The analysis suggests that conceptualisations of the IS organization used by researchers do not reflect the requirements for generating business value from information technology that have been identified in the literature. Whilst highlighting that definitions are vague or more often absent, it challenges the dominant orthodoxy of the IS organization as a separate organizational unit suggesting that it is a more pervasive construct. The implications of this conclusion for practice, research and teaching are considered.},

Research highlights that most business managers continue to be dissatisfied with the value they perceive they are deriving from their organization's information systems investments. On examining the literature, the dominant perspective is that creating value through information systems is primarily the responsibility of the IS function. Accordingly, to address this chronic malaise, attention generally focuses on the IS function with proposed prescriptions ranging from re‐skilling the IS professional through re‐engineering the IS function to the ultimate sanction of outsourcing. This paper examines the problem of value creation from IS investments from an organizational as opposed to an IS functional perspective. Drawing on resource‐based theory, the paper argues that the effective deployment and exploitation of information should be viewed as a ‘strategic asset’. To leverage value from IS, the paper proposes that organizations must recognize and develop information competencies and that the elements of these competencies are distributed throughout the organization and not solely resident in the IS function. Through a multimethodological approach these information competencies are identified and described. The resultant competencies are then studied in an organizational context. The paper ends by drawing conclusions and articulating further research directions and opportunities},

Practicing agile principles in distributed environments therefore poses particular control challenges related to balancing fixed vs. evolving quality requirements and people vs. process‐based collaboration. To investigate these challenges, we conducted an in‐depth case study of a successful agile distributed software project with participants from a Russian firm and a Danish firm. Applying Kirsch's elements of control framework, we offer an analysis of how control was enacted through the project context and in the participants' mediated communication. The analysis reveals that formal measurement and evaluation control were persistently enacted through mediated communication. These formal control practices were, however, predominantly carried out in conjunction with informal roles and relationships such as clan‐like control inherent in agile development. Overall, the study demonstrates that, if appropriately applied, communication technologies can significantly support distributed, agile practices by allowing concurrent enactment of both formal and informal controls. The paper discusses these findings as they relate to previous research and concludes with their implications for future research.},

To reduce ambiguity, hiring professionals have established policies and procedures to facilitate the sourcing and use of information about a candidate. However, recently, a public source of information is increasingly being used—information from social networking sites (SNSs). While conventional wisdom says more information is better and can help make decisions less ambiguous, this relationship may not be as straightforward as expected when facing assessments of candidates. This paper examines two such aspects, information‐task quality and context collapse, and their collective impact on ambiguity when making an assessment of a job candidate. Using data from an online survey‐based experiment, the findings suggest information from SNSs can be useful, yet can create ambiguity for decision makers because of context collapse made possible by SNS technologies.},

In addition, the procedural prompts designed to mitigate cognitive challenges were significantly more effective than simple interrogatory prompts.

As social media researchers, we are intrigued by the problem of virtuality and context in social media research, and how we might apply reflexive research principles to such settings. In social media, the absence of a setting's real physical boundaries (to a large extent) limits participants' ability to create a common experience at the present time and develop a history of shared experiences. As a result, we would contend that many social media researchers' interpretations of data in social media settings are often black‐boxed. In this paper, we argue that many of the challenges concerned with social media settings, by nature, are emergent and linked to their virtual and contextual features. We use the Klein and Myers (1999) framework for traditional interpretive field studies as a vehicle for unpacking these challenges. We contend that these challenges may remain unnoticed if researchers do not actively reflect upon their impact on the research process. In this paper, we present a framework for social media research, considering social media research as a reflexive space, building on the notion of three levels of reflexivity: theory, design and practice. Finally, we discuss some implications of reflexivity for qualitative social media research in IS.},

The discussion is illustrated by a single case study involving the Australian cotton industry. The theoretical framework is informed by three sociological theories, each with its particular paradigmatic assumptions: structuration theory as a meta‐theory, and diffusion of innovations and gender relations as lower‐level theories from notionally opposing paradigms. Theoretical pluralism helped to produce rich findings, illuminating both the social nature of women farmers' roles, the materiality of the cotton farming context, the characteristics of the decision support systems in use and the recursive way in which human agency and institutional pressures shape each other. Because users of so‐called divergent paradigms often face criticism based on the incommensurability issue, one of the main contributions of this paper is to discuss the value of a pluralist and multiparadigmatic theoretical framework in dealing with complex IS social phenomena.},

The analysis demonstrates that organisational interventions must be flexible enough to account for the diversity and variation among women. Further, the analysis shows that it is necessary to move away from ‘one size fits all’ organisational interventions that often reflect stereotypes about women in the IT workforce.},

We contribute to this literature by examining increasingly prevalent yet understudied IT‐mediated social interactions and their effects on knowledge sharing among employees in comparison to face‐to‐face social connections. By integrating the literature on knowledge sharing, social networks, and information systems, we theorize the ability of IT‐mediated social interaction to (1) afford interactions between individuals with heterogeneous backgrounds and (2) facilitate frequent IT‐mediated social interactions that are high in competence‐based trust—both supporting effective sharing of knowledge. Through a social network analysis of the employees in a high‐tech organization, this study finds that IT‐mediated frequent social interactions are the most effective in promoting knowledge sharing.},

We report on an experimental study of the role of electronic mail in the operation of supply chains. A variation of the well known ‘Beer Game’ role‐playing simulation game was computerized and implemented in an internet‐based environment to study the information‐sharing behaviour of teams. A total of 76 teams of four players each competed to achieve best net team profit. Results of the simulation game permit a detailed examination of email use in an organizational context. Findings indicate the expected significant correlation between email use to share information up the supply chain and net team profit. In other words, sharing information in the team has a positive impact on performance. The recorded behaviour of managers in the online simulation indicates that team members use electronic mail successfully to attempt disintermediation of the supply chain. When information is shared online, teams perform significantly better.},

In a multimethod study conducted within a large hospital system, qualitative and quantitative data were collected from 806 clinicians working with electronic medical record systems in 27 inpatient patient‐care units. Multilevel analysis of the data revealed that overall network cohesiveness versus location in structural hole positions related to adaptation differently, depending on the type of network. In help‐seeking networks, location in structural hole positions was negatively related to adaptation, while network cohesion had a bell‐shaped curvilinear relationship with adaptation; in voluntary contribution networks, the overall cohesiveness of the network was negatively related to adaptation, but location in structural hole positions was irrelevant to adaptation. Our findings suggest a more nuanced way of monitoring and utilising different sets of informal social interactions at work to maximise employees' adaptation to IT‐enabled work.},

We further analyse how this collection of practices helps mitigate some, while exacerbating other risks in RE. We provide a framework for evaluating the impact and appropriateness of agile RE practices by relating them to RE risks. Two risks that are intractable by agile RE practices emerge from the analysis. First, problems with customer inability and a lack of concurrence among customers significantly impact agile development. Second, risks associated with the neglecting non‐functional requirements such as security and scalability are a serious concern. Developers should carefully evaluate the risk factors in their project environment to understand whether the benefits of agile RE practices outweigh the costs imposed by the challenges.},

In realising their mission of fighting poverty, prosocial P2P lending platforms maintain a challenging hybrid – online and offline – focus. This paper explores how prosocial P2P lending platforms enact their hybrid orientation. It draws on an inductive qualitative study of Rang De, India's first prosocial P2P lending platform. The analysis highlights five clusters of actions: digital attention‐building, digital credibility‐building, digital empathy‐building, intermediary relationship‐building, and borrower relationship‐building. The paper argues that significant strengths on the online side help establish a sustainable business model.

   abstract                      = {Industry‐wide information infrastructures (IIIS) have recently gained increased attention by policy makers, especially in the healthcare sector where it is believed that IIIS can substantially contribute to the taming of exploding healthcare costs and dramatically improve service quality, e.g., by avoiding widespread medication errors. However, the emergence and evolution of IIIS is as yet poorly understood, partly because the information systems (IS) literature traditionally uses much smaller units of analysis such as projects, organizations or small networks of organization. In this paper, we propose a combined company‐level and industry‐level framework to shed light on the process of IIIS emergence. We demonstrate, for the first time, that IIIS emergence is intricately linked to the industry life cycle for the case of fragmented industries. We also explore the relationship between the industry‐level and company‐level life cycles in the process of IIIS emergence, and develop a novel proposition regarding this relationship. Our findings suggest that current policy initiatives to promote the development of IIIS have not adequately taken industry‐level conditions into consideration.},

The importance of qualitative data and the construction of narratives as a key procedure in the development of theoretical conjectures and empirical generalizations or hypotheses are discussed. This paper also puts the importance of paradigmatic thinking and research into perspective by contrasting this approach with narrative thinking and qualitative research. A recent PhD dissertation on strategic information systems is used to illustrate some of the concepts discussed in the paper. Although the paper advocates the importance of qualitative research and argues that in some respects it may be regarded as more creative than quantitative research, it clearly recognizes that the distinguishing feature of modern science is the formulation of laws, very often mathematical, that capture the essential features of a problem and allow us to make predictions both into the future and about other current situations.},

The goal of this article is to contribute new knowledge on how to carry out research on critical success factors in IS projects using a multi‐method approach. For this purpose, two research projects are presented, each a variation of the research design customized to particular circumstances. First, there is an outline of the research approach taken for a critical success factor research project in the field of portal implementation, with discussion of the strengths and weaknesses of the project. Taking into consideration these experiences, the research approach of a similar critical success factor research project in the field of offshore software development is then described. Finally, recommendations for using the multi‐method research approach in critical success factor research are presented.},

An interactive framework for evolutionary information systems planning is presented together with the results of applying this framework in six organizations. The author has been working with these organizations very intensively, using an action research approach. The main emphasis is on the success of the organizational method of creating information management strategies. The main finding is that an interactive way of generating strategies is not enough. The role of internal ‘project champions’ in both planning and implementation is extremely important. Outside facilitators cannot replace their contribution.},

In this paper, we investigate the mysterious case of the missing paradigm – that of the critical approach to information systems (IS) research. We take Chen and Hirschheim’s survey as our starting point and aim to fill the gap left by the absence of the critical paradigm in their analysis and make some criticisms of their method. Recent years have seen the growth of IS research that consciously adopts a critical perspective. This paper charts the development of critical IS research over the period of 1991–2001, adding some comments on more recent developments. We conclude by critically reflecting on the current development of critical research in the field of IS.},

The essentialist theory, social construction theory and individual differences theory of gender and IT have been proposed to account for the IT gender gap. This study examined evidence for these theories to explain this gap through content analysis of articles published in the national newspaper, The Australian, over three time periods. Newspaper articles report implicit theoretical perspectives on IT and gender and influence the views of the Australian public, including women. While evidence to support all theories was found over the three periods, the essentialist theory was dominant. Increased utility of the individual differences theory to account for the IT gender gap was seen in 2007–2008. The primary contribution of this study is to provide evidence that suggests that theoretical approaches, whether implicit or explicit, shape how people understand the under‐representation of women in the IT workforce. Media interventions are proposed to help redress the imbalance through increased awareness.},

Thispaper explores some of the reasons that may underlie the gender segregation and declining levels of female participation within the field of computing in Europe during the 1990s in both the professional (industrial) and academic spheres. The interrelationships between three areas – communicative processes, social networks and legitimizing claims to knowledge overlaid by gendered‐power relations – are used to analyse and explain the existing situation. The paper draws upon statistical data to explore the extent of gender segregation and then focuses on the authors' own experiences within the UK and Scandinavia in order to explore some of the underlying causes. While direct discrimination does still occur, the paper suggests that indirect, deep‐rooted discrimination is the major reason for the situation that currently exists. Drawing upon our own experiences in academia and business and acknowledging the importance of the institutional context, the paper offers a number of recommendations as to how the current situation may be improved. We suggest first that consideration is given to the pedagogical design and marketing of computing courses so that individuals are initially attracted to computing from far more diverse backgrounds, approaches and interests than at present. Second, we suggest that those with influence in the field reflect upon the constitution and behaviours of the informal networks in which they are involved and seek to include female researchers more actively here. Finally we suggest that consideration is given in more general terms to how the field may become more gender neutral and, thus, more inclusive in the future. Masculine discourses and ‘hard’ skills have dominated within computing for too long and contribute significantly to the declining participation of women within computing.},

These problems may stem from value traditions that are deeply ingrained in managers' cultural environments but not always in harmony with each other. A first step towards working with value complexity is to understand it; we synthesise a model of value positions for e‐Government derived from major traditions in the public administration literature. Four value positions relevant to e‐Government together with their IT assumptions are identified; they reflect the ideals of professionalism, efficiency, service and engagement. A qualitative investigation of Danish local authority managers displays both value congruence and value divergence. The interpretive study results in a theoretical model that combines value positions and relationships, and the model's implications for researchers and practitioners in focusing successful e‐Government initiatives are outlined.},

Previous studies have identified the relationship between trust and project outcomes and suggested trust‐building strategies but have largely ignored the dynamic quality of trust relations through the life of a major project and the complex demands of managing those fluctuations. We investigate evolving trust relationships in a longitudinal case analysis of a large integrated hospital system implementation for the Faroe Islands. Trust relationships suffered various breakdowns, but the project was able to recover and eventually meet its goals. Based on concepts from Giddens' later work on modernity, we develop two approaches for managing dynamic trust relationships in implementation projects: decoupling and re‐engaging.},

However, there is limited understanding of the different processes through which politics unfold. This paper uses 89 ISD projects to develop a taxonomy of political processes in ISD. The taxonomy includes three distinct processes: Tug of War, wherein multiple parties strive to gain project control; Obstacle Race, which involves efforts to resist and pursue the project; and Empire Building, wherein the project is used as an instrument to enhance political or resource bases. The taxonomy is explained using the non‐proponents' view of the project and the balance of power between system's proponents and non‐proponents. We also discuss the emergent taxonomy's implications for how politics can be managed and studied.},

Enriching the usage of these systems can provide organisations with immense benefits. However, limited research has been directed towards understanding post‐adoption IS usage behaviour in general and specifically in the context of self‐service IS. This study proposes post‐adoption IS usage behaviour as a broader concept constituting feature level usage of IS, integration of IS in the work system and exploration of new uses of IS. We evaluate how the new conceptualisation can be used to classify users at different stages of self‐service IS usage. Further, we examine user perceptions that differentiate among the users situated at different self‐service IS usage stages. Data were collected in the context of a self‐service Web‐based IS to validate the post‐adoption IS usage constructs and to examine the proposed thesis. The newly developed conceptual structure and measures for post‐adoption IS usage behaviour exhibit strong psychometric properties. The analysis shows three distinct post‐adoption IS usage stages and highlights that usefulness, user‐initiated learning, ease of use, satisfaction and voluntariness of use differentiate users at the different stages of post‐adoption IS usage. The results show that these variables aggregate into value confirmation and learning orientation as two higher‐level concepts. Further, we evaluate the predictive efficacy of the research model in classifying users into different post‐adoption self‐service IS usage stages. Implications are drawn for future research.},

   abstract                      = {Users occasionally have critical incidents with information systems (IS). A critical IS incident is an IS product or service experience that a user considers to be unusually positive or negative. Critical IS incidents are highly influential in terms of users' overall perceptions and customer relationships; thus, they are crucial for IS product and service providers. Therefore, it is important to study user behaviours after such incidents. Within IS, the relationships between the situational context and user behaviours after critical incidents have not been addressed at all. Prior studies on general mobile use as a related research area have recognized the influence of the situational context, but they have not covered the relationships between specific situational characteristics and different types of user behaviours. To address this gap, we examine 605 critical mobile incidents that were collected from actual mobile application users. Based on our results, we extend current theoretical knowledge by uncovering and explaining the relationships between specific situational characteristics (interaction state, place, sociality and application type) and user behaviours (use continuance, word‐of‐mouth and complaints). We have found, for example, that users are less likely to engage in negative behaviours after negative incidents that take place outdoors or in vehicles than after indoor incidents. This is because users often consider indoor environments to be familiar and treat them with established expectations and low uncertainty: users are accustomed to the notion that the applications function indoors just like before. Further, we present practical implications for mobile application providers by suggesting to them which positive critical incidents are the most beneficial to promote and which negative critical incidents are the most crucial to avoid.},

To address this gap in the research, we used a qualitative approach involving narrative interviews. As a contribution, our findings reveal four types of strains related to well‐being (concentration problems, sleep problems, identity problems, and social relation problems) as well as two different patterns with distinct sets of SNS stressors and SNS characteristics that generate those strains. As practical implications, the findings of this study can help technostressed users to identify their strains, understand their underlying SNS characteristics and SNS stressors, and increase the possibility that they will be able to avoid the strains in the future.},

From a strategic perspective, the paper suggests that framings related to progress, family, material benefit and egalitarianism can help overcome the inevitable tensions and misunderstandings with the community.

While such jobs are attractive and improve life chances, situated ImS employees face the difficult task of transitioning from their traditional communities to the relatively modern ImS workplace. These transition experiences expose them to a variety of work‐life challenges and, at the same time, serve as occasions for development. This paper draws on an inductive qualitative study of an up and coming Indian ImS company and explores how ImS employees experience sociocultural transitions and realize developmental impacts. The findings suggest that compartmentalization and integration strategies help ImS employees manage boundaries arising from the contrasting cultural expectations of the community and the workplace. Impact sourcing employees respond to sociocultural transition challenges in the workplace through a series of cognitive adjustments, which involves the creation of fictive kinships , job crafting , and experimenting with provisional selves . Furthermore, the analysis shows how intense engagement with sociocultural transitions can lead to the development of crucial individual and collective capabilities. In closing, a model of capability development of ImS employees is outlined, and the implications for ImS companies are discussed.},

This study combines the two perspectives and subscribes to the view that organisations’ learning capability moderates their acquiescence to institutional pressures. The study then anchors organisational learning capability to the concept of absorptive capacity and proposes that its two dimensions – potential absorptive capacity (PACAP) and realised absorptive capacity (RACAP) – affect enterprise systems assimilation through different pathways. Our survey‐based empirical study of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) systems in the post‐implementation stage reveals that while both PACAP and RACAP have a positive direct impact on assimilation, PACAP positively moderates the impact of mimetic (institutional) pressures, but not normative (institutional) pressures, on assimilation; whereas RACAP positively moderates the impact of normative pressures, but not mimetic pressures, on assimilation. Thus, our theoretical contribution lies in understanding the distinct ways in which PACAP and RACAP moderate the influence of external institutional pressures on enterprise systems assimilation.},

We explore an important phase of information systems design (ISD), namely task redesign, and especially how different viewpoints enter into the discussions. We study how one particular visual representation, a process diagram, is interpreted and how alternative, even competing, representations are produced verbally. To tie the visual and verbal representations and the representational practices to wider social practices, we develop and use the Extended Three‐dimensional Model of discourse. Visual representations emerged as focal in bringing in the different viewpoints and as reference points for discussions. Our model provided a focused and powerful means to unveil for the outside researchers how the planned changes in tasks and authority relationships instigated a social struggle. The IS designer was an outsider to the client organization and therefore considered only the information system, not the social system in which it was intended to operate. Other participants did not recognize this, therefore, seeing the designer as furthering managerial interests. Seeing task redesign in the social context of a client organization can help IS designers and researchers to understand what the users see naturally, that is, the ISD as a dynamic, enabling but socially constrained process where different viewpoints are represented.},

This paper describes a proposed framework for linking soft systems methodology (SSM), a problem structuring technique for use in messy, ill‐defined problem situations, with Jackson System Development (JSD), an information system development methodology which has object‐oriented characteristics. The approach taken has been to embed the modelling phase of JSD within SSM after the conceptual modelling stage, but before the debate on desirable and feasible change. The JSD modelling phase is carried out at a conceptual rather than a real world level. The framework comprises of a series of steps which enable JSD entity structure diagrams to be derived to a large extent from the activities in an SSM conceptual model. A data model may then be built up by exploding the activities in the conceptual model or by using ‘conceptual hows’ to identify more entities and actions. One of the main benefits expected to arise from the use of such a framework is an improved user requirement definition, which is important to successful systems implementation. The difficulties in actually achieving a link relate to the methodological and philosophical differences between SSM and JSD.},

Findings indicate that a combination of the team's characteristics, team member characteristics and existing levels of intragroup conflict accounts for nearly one‐half of the variance between the best and worst‐performing teams. Furthermore, the level of conflict management moderates the relationship between existing levels of intragroup conflict and performance.

Drawing on cluster analysis, we identify five patterns of team‐level social interactions and the relationships of these patterns to a suite of objective and subjective measures of ISD performance. Analysis leads us to report three findings. First, data indicate that no one of the five identified patterns maximizes all performance measures. Second, data make clear that the most common approach to ISD is the least effective relative to our suite of performance measures. Third, data from this study show that early indications of ISD project success do not predict actual outcomes. These findings suggest two issues for research and practice. First, these findings indicate that varying patterns of social interactions lead to differences in ISD team performance. Second, the findings illustrate that singular measures of ISD performance are an oversimplification and that multiple measures of ISD performance are unlikely to agree.},

We here explore how social media are used to manage CA by the Italian political movement Movimento Cinque Stelle, using the concept of affordances as the conceptual framing. Based on the qualitative case analyses, our study contributes to the knowledge base by identifying a typology of nine affordances supporting CA and exploring how the combined actualisations of some affordances of the typology create antecedents of the fundamental processes of CA. On the basis of the study analysis, we suggest a model to describe how social media support CA through affordances, their combinations, and the creation of antecedents and then formulate implications for research and practice.},

In this paper, we examine the ethics in crowdsourcing practices by focusing on three questions: ( a ) What ethical issues exist in crowdsourcing practices? ( b ) are ethical norms emerging or are issues emerging that require ethical norms? and, more generally, ( c ) how can the ethics of crowdsourcing practices be established? We answer these questions by engaging with Jürgen Habermas' discourse ethics theory to interpret findings from a longitudinal field study (from 2013 to 2016) involving key crowdsourcing participants (workers, platform organizers, and requesters) of three crowdsourcing communities. Grounded in this empirical study, we identify ethical concerns and discuss the ones for which ethical norms have emerged as well as others which remain unresolved and problematic in crowdsourcing practices. Furthermore, we provide normative considerations of how ethical concerns can be identified, discussed, and resolved based on the principles of discourse ethics.},

   abstract                      = {In IS research, social presence is generally defined as the perceived capacity of a communication medium to convey contextual cues normally available in face‐to‐face settings. However, theorizing social presence as a property of the technology has been challenged for decades. The objective of this paper is to develop a more contemporary, interactional view of social presence. To this end, this paper develops a new conceptualization of how participants form the sense that each other is present. We characterize the development of this sense as a skilful accomplishment that entails interactants' joint construction of each other as “real.” Viewing social presence as contingent on social practice, we seek to answer the following research question: “How is social presence accomplished in virtual environments?” To explicate how virtual others are perceived as becoming socially present, that is, emotionally and psychologically “real” to someone interacting with them, we draw from Goffman's work, particularly his concepts of involvement and involvement obligation . Detailing two examples of social interaction in the virtual world Second Life, our analysis highlights the key role that this moral obligation, intrinsic to everyday social interaction, plays in virtual others becoming perceived as psychoemotionally “there.” By outlining a model of how the sense of a virtual other as “real” is produced in and through social interaction, our work contributes a sociological perspective to the construct of social presence and underscores some of the material and social conditions necessary for users to perceive virtual others as present.},

This study fills a void in the VT literature with respect to defining and operationalizing the construct of degree of virtuality, and responds to calls for research that studies ongoing VTs, under real conditions. Data were collected from 30 VTs working in a Canadian technology‐based organization. Degree of virtuality was defined to include three dimensions: the proportion of work time that the VT members spend working apart (team time worked virtually), the proportion of the team's members who work virtually (member virtuality) and the degree of separation of the team's members (distance virtuality). The VTs in this study were found to have varying degrees of virtuality, and although the three dimensions were not highly intercorrelated, all were found to be significantly correlated to variables that have been previously linked to VT effectiveness. The correlations were all in the expected direction (negative), indicating that higher degrees of virtuality are associated with perceived decreases in the quality of team interactions and performance. The results of this research would suggest that the more that teams move away from the proximate form, the more the traditional measures of team effectiveness are negatively impacted.},

The variance model proposes that the five factors in Davenport et al.'s DELTA model of business analytics success factors, six from Watson & Wixom and three from Seddon et al.'s model of organizational benefits from enterprise systems, assist a firm to gain business value from business analytics. A preliminary assessment of the model was conducted using data from 100 customer success stories from vendors such as IBM, SAP and Teradata. Our conclusion is that the business analytics success model is likely to be a useful basis for future research.},

Based on a process analysis of a customer relationship management implementation at a customer service centre, the paper extends the user resistance model proposed by Lapointe and Rivard by identifying three dimensions of user cynicism in IT implementation. It also shows how cynicism, as a form of passive resistance, easily escalates and feeds new forms of resistance.

The process‐oriented holistic enterprise is a new organizational form in which the business process may be perceived as the basic organizational construct. Process management on an enterprise‐wide scale implies a complex integration of business processes. The increased organizational complexity places heavy demands on a firm’s information management capability, and this needs to be managed in a way that best supports the process model. This research has found that in the case of Xerox Ltd, a company that has adopted a holistic approach to process management, the information management process is key to supporting this method of organizing. The main finding is that, in order to support process management, a particular type of information management is required. This includes a need for enterprise‐wide information systems and the centralization of systems development and maintenance. However, the process management is made possible by this type of information management. This may be referred to as the duality concept of information and process management. The research presents findings from an in‐depth participant observation study conducted at the Xerox Ltd headquarters in the UK, and also includes data collected from Xerox France and Xerox UK.},

This list of benefits is consolidated into five benefits dimensions: operational, managerial, strategic, IT infrastructure and organizational, and illustrated using perceived net benefit flow (PNBF) graphs. In a detailed example, the paper shows how the framework has been applied to the identification of benefits in a longitudinal case study of four organizations.},

Drawing on descriptive behavioural decision theory, this study examines whether the planning fallacy, a cognitive bias referring to the tendency of people to underestimate costs and overestimate benefits in evaluating a task to be performed, can provide a theoretical platform for mitigating irrational behaviours in the planning of software development projects. In particular, we argue that taking an outside‐view approach in planning decisions for software development may have the same mitigating effects on time underestimation, scope overload and over‐requirement it has been shown to have on cost underestimation and benefit overestimation. In an experiment investigating this argument, participants were randomly assigned to four groups by manipulating two outside‐view mechanisms: reference information about past completion times (present/absent) and role perspective (developer/consultant). After being presented with a to‐be‐developed software project, they were requested to estimate development times of various software features and to recommend which features to include within project scope given a fixed duration for the entire project. The results confirm that the three problems of time underestimation, scope overload and over‐requirement are manifested in planning decisions for fixed‐schedule software development projects. Moreover, the results show that these problems are mitigated, yet not eliminated, by presenting reference information about past completion times and by having a consultant role.},

   abstract                      = {Recent advances in information technology (IT), such as the advent of business intelligence (BI) systems, have increased the ability of organisations to collect and analyse data to support decisions. There is little focus to date, however, on how BI systems might play a role in organisational knowledge creation – in organisational knowing. We develop a conceptual framework of organisational knowing based on a synthesis of the literature, and use this as a framework to investigate how BI systems facilitate knowing in a case organisation. We identify two practices triggered by BI systems that distinguish them from prior applications of IT: the ability to initiate problem articulation and dialogue, and that of data selection (e.g. to address information needs of organisational decision makers at different managerial levels). This study provides empirical evidence of the performative outcome of BI systems in relation to organisational knowing through the practices of articulation and data selection. It provides a practice perspective on BI and focuses on the role of BI systems in organisational knowing thereby opening up a new departure for BI research that considers the implications of BI systems in organisations with actual practice in mind.},

We applied an established psychological technique (Repertory Grid) to guide our interviews with 21 experienced IS professionals, who have had extensive experience in software development teams. The comprehensive list of important characteristics was analysed qualitatively using open coding method of grounded theory. Fifty‐nine unique characteristics were identified and classified into eight categories. Among them, attitude/motivation, knowledge, interpersonal/communication skills, and working/cognitive ability were perceived by research participants to be the most important categories. Our study provides a context‐specific (i.e. software development team) evaluation of important characteristics of IS professionals. The results have significant implications for IS recruiting, IS training, IS staffing, and IS human resource management. Our study also supplements the research on management of IS development teams.},

In this study, we examine the phenomenon of stock touting during pump and dump campaigns, in which deceivers advertise stocks to profit from an increased price level. We observe that the positive prospects promised are not confirmed by corporate disclosures and financial news. Furthermore, manipulators select targeted financial instruments based on specific stock and company characteristics. Manipulators avoid signals of anomaly and prefer unknown stocks. We find that stock touting has a positive market impact but that it is followed by a large decline in stock price in the subsequent days, causing investors to lose substantial amounts of their investments. We consider the impact of information generation, information content, and information presentation on the corresponding market reaction. Interestingly, information generation influences the demand for the stock, but information content and information presentation drive the willingness to pay. Our results are highly relevant for Internet users, software vendors, and market surveillance authorities, as a deep understanding of such information‐based manipulations is necessary to develop appropriate countermeasures.},

Although significant work has been done, there is yet to emerge a research approach that permits a penetrating study of the phenomenon of power by virtue of adopting a Machiavellian stance. This paper proposes such an approach in the form of an interpretivist position combined with a theoretical framework whose origin lies in political science and the sociology of technology. In developing its philosophical argument, the paper compares three meta‐theories that have been applied to study IS: Phenomenology, Critical Theory and Structuration Theory. All three are compared in terms of their epistemological position regarding the relationship between power and IS. We argue that, although enlightening, those meta‐theories fail to unravel the hidden and strategic nature of power. The paper concludes by proposing a particular theoretical formulation that, rather than censoring power and politics, will provide the epistemological means for unravelling them.},

This is followed by a brief account of the limits of both quantitative studies of ‘objective’ variables and qualitative studies of ‘subjective meanings’. The emerging case for IS research on organizational practices is set out, coupled with an account of Suchman's (1987) study of how workers make use of a computer‐based system attached to a photocopier.

This paper further reveals that their use as tools depends on deeper underlying structures/factors embedded within the community, namely, informal networks and trust among people. The new conceptual model and theoretical propositions are then illustrated by a qualitative study undertaken in Bulgarian organisations. This illustrative case provides support for the model, where TMS and Web 2.0 are found to facilitate KS. It further demonstrates that informal networks and trust among people support the use and the positive effects of these tools. The contribution of this paper is in the new analytical approach and conceptual model developed, which advances our understanding of interactive KS by explaining the linkages between the various factors involved.},

These include assuming that (1) the scale elasticity, i.e. returns to scale, is constant throughout the entire output range; (2) the elasticity of substitution between inputs is one, whereas it can be anywhere from zero to infinity in practice; and (3) there are no complex interrelationships between inputs, i.e. no squared or product terms. The translog production function (used in two previous studies) does not make these assumptions and is therefore more accurate. However, the two previous studies found no significant difference between the two. This research has extended previous work on the impact of IT investments by providing more accurate results in some areas and new findings in others. IT's importance is shown to be much greater than previously thought. The translog function is used to demonstrate that the productivity paradox does not hold (i.e. both IT labor and capital indeed have a significant impact on firm revenues), but with considerably different results, i.e. the impact of IT is markedly more significant than that obtained from the Cobb–Douglas. Another interesting finding is that of scale elasticity. Our results show that this is less than 1, implying decreasing returns to scale of output. Finally, the substitutability between inputs was determined, which is not possible with the Cobb–Douglas. It was found that the partial elasticities of substitution for IT labor with IT capital and non‐IT labor were quite substantial.},

Hypertext or hypermedia, on the other hand, involves a user browsing through a database of textual or multimedia information in response to a variety of types of information need. Thus information retrieval can be said to have a searching metaphor while hypertext has a browsing analogy. Initially, these two technologies for information access appear to be very different, almost competitive in nature. In this paper information retrieval systems are briefly reviewed and hypertext systems are also examined. These two techniques for accessing information have been integrated into a prototype system which is described. The system dynamically generates guided tours in response to a user's query and the tour guides the user through the hypertext. Some experiments reporting on the effectiveness of this as an information access strategy are given.},

The remaining 74% are troubled in some way: they are either cancelled before the development cycle is completed (28%) or are delivered late, over budget, and with reduced functionality (46%). In many cases, the most cost‐effective solution would be to abort the troubled project early in the cycle, but senior managers are often unaware of the project's problems. Anecdotal evidence and at least one recent study suggest that losses are sometimes increased by the reluctance of organizational members to transmit negative information concerning a project and its status. Thus, although evidence of a failing course of action may exist in the lower ranks of an organization, this information sometimes fails to be communicated up the hierarchy or is substantially distorted in the process. The result is that decision‐makers with the authority to change the direction of the project are unaware of its true status. By modelling this reluctance to transmit negative project status information and improving our understanding of the phenomenon, we believe that prescriptions can be developed eventually to reduce the losses from troubled development projects. In this theory development paper, we examine the reluctance to transmit negative information and develop a theoretical model that explains this phenomenon within a software project context. The model we develop draws on literature from the fields of organizational behaviour and communications, ethics, economics, information systems and psychology, and points the direction for future research.},

   abstract                      = {Information technology use is typically assumed to have positive effects for users, yet information technology use may also lead to negative consequences with various degrees of gravity. In the current work, we build on dual‐systems theories to investigate negative consequences associated with mobile phones use (MPU), defined as the extent to which the use of mobile phones is perceived to create problems in managing one's personal and social life. According to dual‐system theories, human behaviour is guided by two systems: reflexive (automatic) and reflective (control), which most of the time work in harmony. But when the two systems come into conflict, they will both complete to exert their influences over behaviour. Thus, we view the negative consequences associated with MPU as an outcome of the tug‐of‐war between the two systems influencing our day‐to‐day behaviours, where reflexive system is represented in our study by MPU habits and reflective system is represented by self‐regulation. We hypothesise that the influence of habit and self‐regulation on these negative consequences will be mediated through MPU. A partial least square analysis of 266 responses was used to validate and test our model. The study results generally support our model. The theoretical and practical implications of our study are discussed.},

While some early stage internet start‐ups have quickly become major successes, others fail to secure required follow‐up funding and collapse. In this paper, we build on and extend the emerging business model research stream with the aim of better understanding the differences between successful and unsuccessful early stage internet start‐ups. In the qualitative first part of our mixed‐method study, 17 expert informant interviews reveal that internet start‐up business models are in permanent flux, continually changed and adapted by founders, who identify their professional social network (i.e. their social capital) as a critically important factor for developing the business model and ultimately making their start‐ups successful. In the quantitative second part of the study, we test this claim based on a social network analysis of 70 internet start‐ups and their 145 founders. We find strong support for the critical importance of the founders' social capital for early stage internet start‐up success. The findings of this study advance our understanding of the relationship between founders' social capital, the development of business models and the success of early stage internet start‐ups.},

One solution is a type of information and communications technology workaround, a feral information system (FIS) – defined as a workaround designed to achieve certain requirements by using any information technology tool that an end user uses in conjunction with, or instead of, the mandated information system. To explore this, we conducted a case study at a large utility company. We conclude that feral information systems are not a behavioural deviance. FISs are by‐products of end users seeking operational efficiency, namely, to nullify additional transactional costs imposed by the ES. Our findings suggest that end users of ES will fall into one of four modes of operation: mode 1, where end users submit to the ES; mode 2, where they dismiss the ES; mode 3, where they develop an FIS that remains hidden from the ES proponents; and mode 4, where they operate the FIS in open defiance of the ES proponents. In this research, we deliberately take the practitioner view and, therefore, outline how different pressures help to create an FIS as a response to a poorly mandated ES. We also make a theoretical contribution by exploring issues that lead to workarounds and suggest that future research into these modes of operation can be theorized in future proposed studies.},

Such insights would enable a deeper understanding about the effects of individual differences on salient job‐related outcomes. In this research, by leveraging the distinctions in personality traits offered by the big five personality traits in the five‐factor model and grounding the research in the transactional model of stress and coping, we theorise the moderating influence of personality traits on the relationships between technostress creators and job outcomes, namely job burnout and job engagement. Specifically, the study theorises the mechanisms through which each of the specific personality traits openness‐to‐experience, neuroticism, agreeableness, conscientiousness and extraversion interacts with technostress creators to differently influence job burnout and job engagement. We test the proposed model in a field study based on a survey of senior organisational managers who regularly use information and communication technologies for executing professional tasks. Although technostress creators are generally associated with negative job outcomes, our results also show that for individuals with certain personality traits, technostress creators may result in positive job outcomes. The study thus contributes to the technostress literature, specifically by incorporating the salient role of individual differences. The study also provides insights for managers who should pay special attention to allocating specific job roles to employees with particular personality traits in order to optimise job‐related outcomes.},

This paper offers an insight into the games software development process from a time perspective by drawing on an in‐depth study in a games development organization. The wider market for computer games now exceeds the annual global revenues of cinema. We have, however, only a limited scholarly understanding of how games studios produce games. Games projects require particular attention because their context is unique. Drawing on a case study, the paper offers a theoretical conceptualization of the development process of creative software, such as games software. We found that the process, as constituted by the interactions of developers, oscillates between two modes of practice: routinized and improvised, which sediment and flux the working rhythms in the context. This paper argues that while we may predeterminately lay down the broad stages of creative software development, the activities that constitute each stage, and the transition criteria from one to the next, may be left to the actors in the moment, to the temporality of the situation as it emerges. If all development activities are predefined, as advocated in various process models, this may leave little room for opportunity and the creative fruits that flow from opportunity, such as enhanced features, aesthetics and learning.},

In order to support this proposition, this paper will suggest a way of classifying critical research that differs from definitions common IS research. According to the current definition, research is critical when it is motivated by the intention to change social realities and promote emancipation. Based on this critical intention, critical research is furthermore characterized by critical topics, critical theories, and critical methodologies. Using these criteria of critical research, the paper argues that critical research is ethical in nature. To support this view, the paper introduces the concepts of ethics and morality by analysing two traditions of moral philosophy, here called the ‘German tradition’ and the ‘French tradition’. Using three examples of current critical research in information systems, the paper will show that ethics and morality strongly influence critical intention, topics and theories. Having thus established the ethical nature of critical research, the paper concludes by discussing the weaknesses of critical research from the point of view of ethics and morality.},

Much research therefore concentrates on the way in which information security policies contribute to the protection of systems from internal and external threats. Such work is legitimate and important, but it often fails to explore alternative views of security and related policies. Against this backdrop, this paper seeks to provide novel insights into the role and purpose of information security policies by reviewing them through a critical theoretical lens. It presents the results of a critical discourse analysis which looked for evidence of ideology and hegemony within a sample of information security policies from the UK's National Health Service. The findings support the contention that an alternative description of information security policies from a critical perspective provides better insights into existing problems than most mainstream work.

Another target of this case study was to investigate the issue of modularity in open source as this characteristic is being considered crucial by the proponents of open source for this type of software development. We have empirically assessed the relationship between the size of the application components and the delivered quality measured through user satisfaction. We have determined that, up to a certain extent, the average component size of an application is negatively related to the user satisfaction for this application.},

Therefore, using questionnaire‐based data, this study examined the potential effects of different aspects of virtuality on a knowledge‐sharing model. Social exchange theory was used to develop a model relating trust to knowledge sharing and knowledge sharing to team effectiveness. The moderating effects of virtuality and task interdependence on these relationships were examined. A strong positive relationship was found between trust and knowledge sharing for all types of teams (local, hybrid and distributed), but the relationship was stronger when task interdependence was low, supporting the position that trust is more critical in weak structural situations. Knowledge sharing was positively associated with team effectiveness outcomes; however, this relationship was moderated by team imbalance and hybrid structures, such that the relationship between sharing and effectiveness was weaker. Organizations should therefore avoid creating unbalanced or hybrid virtual teams.},

On the basis of that review, we elaborate on the different roles that IT can assume to support entrepreneurial operations and value creation in these settings. Our findings suggest that IT plays four major roles in entrepreneurial operations: as a facilitator , making the operations of start‐ups easier; as a mediator for new ventures' operations; as an outcome of entrepreneurial operations; and as a ubiquity , becoming the business model itself. Leveraging these roles of IT, we develop a set of definitions to clear up definition uncertainties surrounding IT‐associated new ventures such as digital start‐ups and digital business models. We also outline a research agenda for IT‐associated entrepreneurship research based on identified roles, types, and gaps.},

The paper begins with an exploration of the concept formative faculties in relation to ‘given’ and ‘non‐given’ objects. The concepts of parti and format are then presented as a way to grasp the ‘whole’ of an information system. How formats can be used in information systems design is discussed as well as how this leads to the act of sketching as an important but neglected activity in information systems design. Sketching is promoted by introducing diathenic graphologue as the art of ‘giving form to the unknown’. The paper ends by suggesting how formats and diathenic graphologue can be practised and included as important aspects of information systems design education and training.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. Since the mid‐1980s there has been a growing interest in the application of soft systems methodology (SSM) to the information systems design process. This interest has resulted from attempts to overcome the recognized deficiencies of conventional computer systems analysis methods and techniques. A particular problem which has received attention over the past 5 years is the epistemological and operational differences between the investigative process of the pre‐design stage and the technological specification. We suggest that this argument is somewhat unproductive and advocate a necessary rethinking about the nature of information systems and the use of technology to support their activities. A re‐evaluation of the way that we set about designing computer‐based information systems suggests that many of the problems of conventional systems analysis methods may be alleviated by an approach that allows the ‘client’, or ‘user’, to have a greater control over the identification, specification and development of their information system(s). The authors' belief in this course of action has led to the development of client‐led design as an underpinning philosophy for user participation in the design of computer‐based information systems. Client‐led design draws upon and develops concepts and tools from ‘interpretive’, or ‘soft’, systems thinking and, in particular, can be seen as providing a framework for the type of subjective inquiry that Checkland & Scholes (1990) referred to as ‘ideal‐type’ mode 2 SSM. This paper is related to the papers published in the Journal of Information Systems (Vol. 3, No. 3), which was a special edition to illustrate the influence of ‘soft’ systems thinking upon information systems design and development.},

We conducted a detailed field study of users in three countries who execute tasks collectively using social media capabilities within their ES. The findings provide rich insights into these social media interactions, their influence on ES users' sense of ‘presence’ and their impact on the completion of tasks. Our key research contribution is to introduce the idea of ‘virtual co‐presence’ as a means of understanding the digitally mediated presence of ES users. In addition, we demonstrate how virtual co‐presence and the relationships afforded by social media shape ES users' interactions and collective completion of tasks in a dispersed work context. Drawing on the insights gained from the effect of virtual co‐presence on ES users, the paper outlines some implications for the theory and practice of collective work in ES use.},

We also extend the IDTGIT by exploring how technology is used by women entrepreneurs in their DSI ventures and how technology facilitates the social impact of such ventures. This paper draws on a qualitative study using interviews with 17 women entrepreneurs in Australia, and our findings indicate that individual identity, individual influences and social and structural influences play a significant role in inhibiting women entrepreneurs' business ventures but technology helps to create opportunities for women entrepreneurs to address these factors. We also found that technology plays a role in helping women entrepreneurs to pursue social innovation in two different ways: through social innovation that is embodied by technology and social innovation that is enabled by technology. Our findings further indicate the social impact of DSI in the areas of education, employment, environment and climate, community development and progress and healthcare. The theoretical and practical implications of DSI for women entrepreneurs are provided.},

Scholars advise that business ecosystems are inherently fluid, unbounded and amorphous and thus that their boundaries can shift. Practitioners further suggest that business ecosystems are characterised by inter‐network – as opposed to inter‐firm – competition, and, moreover, that they are mainly driven by technological advancements. And yet few studies examine the role of information technology (IT) in driving boundary practices that enable the formation and transformation of business ecosystems. Through an in‐depth case study of technology‐enabled transformations within the Korean pop music (K‐pop) industry, our study examines how the digital transformation of business ecosystems unfolded. Our study contributes to the emergent body of knowledge on business ecosystems in a number of ways. Our investigations uncover the conditions under which the constituent firms operate and analyse the role of IT and its implications on new organisational forms. From our analysis, we present a framework that reveals insights on critical boundary practices and formative strategies for digital business ecosystems. We illustrate how these boundary practices drive industry change, from a largely linear content delivery system resembling a value chain to a new value network of co‐specialisation and self‐organisation among firms in a new digital business ecosystem.},

Through an investigation of M.com, a leading multisided online retailing platform in China, this study provides a clear thesis of resource interdependencies and IT‐enabled capabilities forged during operational processes to realise operational agility. Our investigation, observations, and reflections from practice substantiate a model of how a platform like M.com cultivates IT‐driven resource‐interdependent competencies and capabilities tantamount to realising operational agility. The model shows how IT enables three capabilities—localised, synergistic, and optimised—which reflect the effective co‐ordination of three resource interdependencies (pooled, sequential, and reciprocal) during M.com's complex operations and processes, and explicates the consequences. For research, we postulate that IT‐enabled operational agility in complex organisational forms, cultivated through the development of resource‐interdependent capabilities to deliver effective sensing and response mechanisms, forms effective strategies for the B2C platform in dynamic marketplace conditions.},

This paper presents the result of an action research project which applied a new approach labelled as the Delta Model developed by Hax and Wilde (2001) of Sloan School of Management to strategy development for brick‐n‐mortar companies launching e‐business initiatives. The case company is called Whetstone Food Ingredients (WFI), located in UK. The company is firmly embedded in the agri‐product industry and operates in the ‘egg by‐product’ subsector. This paper is based upon action research supplemented by a programme of in‐depth interviews with managers at WFI for various aspects of their supply chain and e‐business initiatives. On the basis of these interviews and the companies also made a range of documents available throughout. These included internal memos, strategy plans, operational control documents and minutes of meetings. The Delta Model and Davenport's methodology of business process reengineering were adopted to structure this analysis. Used in conjunction, they helped to develop a vision, analyse the business processes, identify critical business processes, benchmark the critical processes, and then develop the information technology infrastructure. The infrastructure thus supported the critical business processes and leveraged the e‐business supply chain to enable the company to gain competitive edge.},

It examines how and why the use of IS causes individuals to experience various demands that they find stressful. This paper develops a framework for guiding future research in technostress experienced by individuals in organizations. We first review and critically analyse the state of current research on technostress reported in journals from the IS discipline and the non‐IS disciplines that study stress in organizations (eg, organizational behaviour and psychological stress). We then develop our framework in the form of the “technostress trifecta”—techno‐eustress, techno‐distress, and Information Systems design principles for technostress. The paper challenges 3 key ideas imbued in the existing technostress literature. First, it develops the argument that, in contrast to negative outcomes, technostress can lead to positive outcomes such as greater effectiveness and innovation at work. Second, it suggests that instead of limiting the role of IS to that of being a stress creator in the technostress phenomenon, it should be expanded to that of enhancing the positive and mitigating the negative effects of technostress through appropriate design. Third, it lays the groundwork for guiding future research in technostress through an interdisciplinary framing that enriches both the IS and the psychological stress literatures through a potential discourse of disciplinary exchange.},

Integrating three theoretical strands—the concept of feature‐rich Information Technology (IT), the theory of technology frames, and distraction as a coping behaviour—we theorize two types of coping behaviours in response to stressors experienced from the use of SNS. These are ‐ distraction through use of the same SNS and distraction through activities outside the use of the SNS. We hypothesize relationships between stressors from SNS use, the two coping behaviours and SNS addiction. We further articulate the role of SNS use habit. We test the hypotheses through a three‐wave survey of 444 Facebook users with data collected at three different points in time. The paper's contributions are to theorize and empirically validate the psychological concept of distraction as a coping behaviour in response to stress from the use of SNS and, in doing so, explain why there may be a link between technostress from and technology addiction to the use of the same SNS.},

Our findings show a negative association between technostress creators and performance. We find that, while traditional effort‐based mechanisms such as building technology competence reduce the impact of technostress creators on technology‐enabled innovation and performance, more empowering mechanisms such as developing technology self‐efficacy and information systems (IS) literacy enhancement and involvement in IS initiatives are required to counter the decrease in overall performance because of technostress creators. Noting that the professional sales context offers increasingly high expectations for technology‐enabled performance in an inherently interpersonal‐oriented and relationship‐oriented environment with regard to overall performance, and high failure rates for IS acceptance/use, the study uses survey data collected from 237 institutional sales professionals.},

This includes expectations regarding the skill levels exhibited by the providers of the IS services and products. Typically, the expectations are examined as gaps from perceived performance or as gaps from realistic expectations. The interaction of these gaps has not been thoroughly explored in past research, although recent theories anticipate both gaps are crucial in meeting the desires of the users. A matched pair sample of IS users and IS providers is used to collect data on expected skill levels and perceived delivery of the skills demanded. Gaps, both between these two stakeholder groups regarding expectations and within the user group regarding perceived delivery, are found to impact user satisfaction in a two‐way analysis. The results indicate that expectations should be managed to higher levels and commonly understood across the user and provider groups.},

In this paper, we build on a realist ontology of affordance and an interpretive epistemology of how affordances are perceived and actualised to trace the process of actualisation. On the basis of insights drawn from a case study of a telemedicine project in a remote mountainous region of Nepal, we develop a concept, which we call the “Trajectory of Affordances.” Trajectory of Affordances captures the complex relations between affordances of IT and the role of goal‐oriented actors who perceive and then play a vital role in actualising them, using capabilities that are enabled by facilitating conditions to take the necessary action. Trajectory of Affordances shows that the affordances of IT can travel from perception to actualisation through multiple paths, sometimes clustering together, and in the process, often lead to the emergence of new affordances.},

Despite its growing importance, we still know little about the underlying network effects that drive the evolution and growth of crowdfunding platforms. Specifically, is the evolution and growth primarily driven by a growing number of entrepreneurial projects attracting funders, or do funders primarily attract entrepreneurs, or does a reciprocal relationship exist between the two market sides? We also explore whether and how input control, a common gatekeeping mechanism on platforms, has an impact on the formation of network effects. By analyzing eight years of data on the evolution of Kickstarter, one of the leading reward‐based crowdfunding platforms, we find that network effects are asymmetric. An increasing number of entrepreneurial projects has a strong and significant effect on the installed base of funders (cross‐side network effects) and also attracts other entrepreneurs to the platform (same‐side network effects). However, an increased installed base of funders does not have an effect on the growth of either side of the market. We also find that, under weaker input control, cross‐side network effects and same‐side network effects are weaker and less sustainable. Taken together, our exploratory evidence suggests that the relationship between the market sides on crowdfunding platforms might be less reciprocal than expected, having profound implications for entrepreneurs and providers of crowdfunding platforms.},

Based on this case study, we first discuss three leapfrogging opportunities afforded by e‐commerce, which were successfully embraced by the grassroots communities to begin the transformative journey. We then reveal three obstacles that emerged during the technology leapfrogging process, which have challenged the sustainability of the grassroots DSI endeavour. Lastly, we discuss three top‐down interventions that have been instrumental in overcoming the bottleneck of grassroots leapfrogging development and subsequently nurture a self‐sustaining, resilient community. Overall, by discussing some of the common barriers to the growth and sustainability of DSI, and how they have been addressed, this article offers insights and recommendations for policymakers, public and private sector practitioners, and communities in underdeveloped regions to navigate both the potentials and pitfalls of technology leapfrogging, and ultimately build a pathway towards resilience and sustainability.},

Each visited one among several real web sites chosen across three industries (i.e. banking, pharmaceuticals and insurance). We define site communality as the extent to which web site content signals that a company's relationship with its customers goes beyond the formal, ‘tit for tat’ business dealings that are typically expected from purely commercial exchanges, and instead, more closely abide by the norms and behaviours evocative of friendships and/or family relations. Our results indicate that demonstration of caring, role spanning and authenticity/genuineness are its most important dimensions. Preliminary, findings also show that site communality is positively related to the benevolence dimension of online trust which is an important antecedent of loyalty. The practical implications of our study are discussed in the form of recommendations to help companies in designing web sites high in site communality.},

A company's information technology (IT) structure and its brand architecture are intended to minimize transaction costs both within the organization and between the organization and its customers. Business‐to‐Consumer (B2C) e‐commerce fundamentally alters the structure of those transaction costs relevant to the IT structure and the brand architecture. We conducted a survey among 102 chief information officers and chief marketing officers in 67 of the 100 most important B2C enterprises in Austria. The results show that companies typically implement a certain set of changes in the IT structure and the brand architecture if B2C e‐commerce is highly important to them and that these changes result in a stronger integration within and between the IT structure and the brand architecture. B2C e‐commerce projects thus require closely aligned conceptual, organizational and financial measures in both areas.},

Very limited attention is paid to comprehensive theoretical conceptions of the complex phenomenon of organizational online networking. We address this gap by adopting a theoretical framework of the deep structure of organizational online networking with a focus on their emerging meaning for the employees. We apply and assess the framework in a qualitative case study of a large‐scale implementation of a corporate social network site (SNS) in a global organization. We reveal organizational online networking as a multi‐dimensional phenomenon with multiplex relationships that are unbalanced, primarily consist of weak ties and are subject to temporal change. Further, we identify discourse drivers and information retrievers as two mutually interdependent actor roles as an explanation for uneven levels of user contributions to the SNS. Based on our analysis, we elicit abstract order principles, such as topical discourses, and identify transactive memory theory as a potent explanation of the evolving interaction structures. We finally discuss how the deep structure framework can contribute to future research on organizational networks.},

To shed light on the issue, we collected data at two organisations where managers had provided IT service support workers with IT service management (ITSM) tools incorporating functionality for knowledge sharing. Using critical discourse analysis and rhetorical analysis techniques, we contrasted primary data representative of IT service support practice with other primary and publicly available secondary data reflecting the prevailing discourse of IT service managers. Through this analysis, we identify an apparent dissonance between ITSM managerial and worker discourses that reflect opposing epistemologies. Managers are optimistic about the benefits of ICT‐based knowledge sharing, whereas the practice of workers is revealed to privilege self‐reliance and interpersonal knowledge sharing. By taking a dual, management–worker, perspective, we provide fresh insight into why ICT‐based knowledge sharing is problematic. As a theoretical contribution, we propose that dysfunctional intra‐organisational conflict can arise where incompatible management and worker practices become institutionalised through the simultaneous diffusion of conflicting discourses.},

ADDs use various means, both invasive and non‐invasive, to ascertain individual intent to deceive or engage in malicious behaviour. Many papers introducing ADDs use signal detection theory to compare a technique's ability to detect malicious intent with other techniques, but in doing so, they do not include contextual information such as base rate and cost. In this paper, we aim to improve future research by showing how the inclusion of contextual information provides a more realistic picture of the research. Through both theoretical arguments and a real‐data example, we show that especially for those contexts where malicious intent is infrequent (ie, with low base rates of deception) that not factoring in the base rate overestimates the accuracy and therefore usefulness. We conclude with recommendations for how future research should provide a fuller picture of the accuracy and usefulness of ADDs.},

However, given the dramatic increase in the use of technology during the last few years, susceptibility to IT addiction is increasingly becoming an important issue for technology users and IS researchers. In this paper, we report the results of a study that focuses on identifying variations in user liability to IT addiction, which reflects the susceptibility of individual users to develop IT addiction. First, a review of the literature in different disciplines (e.g. health, psychology and IS) allows us to better understand the concepts of IT addiction and liability to addiction. The literature review also provides an overview of the antecedents and consequences associated with IT addiction. Then, building on the analysis of 15 in‐depth interviews and 182 exploratory open‐ended surveys collected from smartphone users, we apply the concept of liability to addiction in the IT use context and propose a typological theory of user liability to IT addiction. Our typology reveals five ideal types; each can be associated to a user profile ( addict , fanatic , highly engaged , regular and thoughtful ). Building upon both the extant literature and our results, we put forth propositions to extend the theoretical contributions of the study. We finally discuss the contributions and implications of our paper for research and practice.},

Empirically, we investigate openness in the genetics domain through a longitudinal study of the evolving communal infrastructure for data related to 2 genes influencing women's susceptibility to breast and ovarian cancer ( BRCA1 and BRCA2 ). We follow the continuously shifting “topology” of the BRCA information infrastructure and trace the multiple repositories that are put in place and the different arrangements for data collection, curation/quality assurance, access, and control that are tried out. In our analysis, we illustrate the actors' strategies for curbing the subtractability and exclusion attributes of data. We then propose a theoretically informed and empirically grounded framework that can guide understanding and action taking to enable data openness.},

Specifically, our predictors were (1) gender, age, income and education; (2) the Big Five personality characteristics, i.e. extraversion, neuroticism, conscientiousness, agreeableness and openness to experience; and (3) personal innovativeness with information technology. We conducted a field study in a village in India. We collected data from over 300 heads of household. We found support for our model, with most variables being significant and explaining 40% of the variance in e‐Government portal use.},

   abstract                      = {Agile methods are widely used in the software industry as a way to more rapidly develop and deliver new software. They define iterative work processes, advocate self‐organization and openness for change, and prescribe how software developers interact with each other and external stakeholders. Despite their popularity, it is unclear how agile methods influence work exhaustion in software developers and how developer skills play into this effect. On the one hand, agile methods may reduce software developers' work exhaustion by levelling out their workload across the entire duration of a project. On the other hand, agile methods exert a high level of pressure on software developers to continuously deliver working software, create many intensive social interactions, and to frequently adapt to changes. In light of these effects, prior research could not explain why some software developers become less exhausted from using agile methods, whereas others perceive the exact opposite. Based on the job demand‐control model, we develop a theoretical model connecting agile method use to individual developer skills and to two established determinants of employee exhaustion: role conflict and role ambiguity. We tested our research model in a field study among 1894 software developers in 217 project teams that used agile methods. The random coefficient modelling results show that agile method use facilitates the achievement of clear and unambiguous role perceptions and thereby reduces work exhaustion in developers, particularly if developers possess the organizational skills to effectively interact with others in their organization. We highlight implications for theory on the individual‐level effects of software development methods and provide practical insights for software companies.},

The deep structure of an information system comprises those properties that manifest the meaning of the real‐world system the information system is intended to model.

The first, the representational model, proposes a set of constructs that enable the ontological expressiveness of grammars used to model information systems (such as the entity‐relationship model) to be evaluated. The second, the state‐tracking model, proposes four requirements that information systems must satisfy if they are to faithfully track the real‐world system they are intended to model. The third, the good‐decomposition model, proposes three necessary conditions that information systems must meet if they are to be well decomposed. The three models provide a theoretically based, structured way of evaluating grammars that are used to analyse, design and implement information systems and scripts that have been generated using these grammars to describe specific information systems.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. In recent years, an increasing amount of attention has been paid to information systems (IS) outsourcing by practitioners as well as academics. However, our understanding of the factors that affect outsourcing success is hardly complete. By adopting transaction cost theory (TCT) as the theoretical foundation, this study analyses the implications of transaction attributes on the consequences of customized software outsourcing practice. The research model includes three exogenous variables (contractor reputation, asset specificity and uncertainty) and two endogenous variables (post‐contractual opportunism and outsourcing success). The moderating effects of asset specificity on the relationships between uncertainty and the endogenous variables are also examined. Based on data collected in Taiwan, a research model is constructed to test the hypotheses derived from the theory. The empirical evidence is generally supportive of the theory but with some important exceptions. In particular, contractor reputation and uncertainty have the predicted effects on the contractor’s post‐contractual opportunism perceived by the client and outsourcing success, but asset specificity shows a negative effect on post‐contractual opportunism and a positive effect on outsourcing success, which are opposite to the typical predictions of TCT. Thus, in addition to the supportive findings of the theory, this study also raises an important research question regarding the effects of asset specificity on outsourcing for future research to explore.},

However, the updated IS success model has not been empirically validated in the context of e‐commerce. Further, the existing IS/e‐commerce success models have been subject to considerable debate on the ‘IS Use’ and ‘Perceived Usefulness’ constructs, and the nomological structure of the updated DeLone and McLean model is somewhat inconsistent with the IS acceptance and marketing literature. Based on the IS and marketing literature, this paper respecifies and validates a multidimensional model for assessing e‐commerce systems success. The validated model consists of six dimensions: Information Quality, System Quality, Service Quality, Perceived Value, User Satisfaction and Intention to Reuse. Structural equation modelling techniques were applied to data collected by questionnaire from 240 users of e‐commerce systems in Taiwan. The empirical evidence suggests that Intention to Reuse is affected by Perceived Value and User Satisfaction, which, in turn, are influenced by Information Quality, System Quality and Service Quality. The nomological structure of the respecified e‐commerce systems success model is concurred with that of the technology acceptance model (TAM) in the IS field and the consumer behaviour models in the traditional business‐to‐business and retail contexts. The findings of this study provide several important implications for research and practice. This paper concludes by discussing the contributions of this study and the limitations that could be addressed in future studies.},

The emergence of these alternative approaches was very much industry‐led at the outset, and while agile method research is growing, the vast majority of these studies are descriptive and often lack a strong theoretical and conceptual base. Insights from innovation adoption research can provide a new perspective on analysing agile method use. This paper is based on an exploratory study of the application of the innovation assimilation stages to understand the use of agile practices, focusing in particular on the later stages of assimilation, namely acceptance, routinisation and infusion. Four case studies were conducted, and based on the case study findings, the concepts of acceptance, routinisation and infusion were adapted and applied to agile software development. These adapted concepts were used to glean interesting insights into agile practice use. For example, it was shown that the period of use of agile practices does not have a proportional effect on their assimilation depths. We also reflected on the sequential assumption underlying the assimilation stages, showing that adopting teams do not always move through the assimilation stages in a linear manner.},

Extant research has highlighted the challenges associated with managing knowledge in virtual settings. However, researchers are still struggling to provide effective guidance to practitioners in this field. We believe that a better understanding of individual virtual competency is a potential avenue for managing the complexity of knowledge transfer in virtual settings. In particular, we suggest that optimal knowledge transfers can be achieved by individuals armed with the right personal capabilities and skills for virtual work, particularly when those knowledge transfers are emergent, bottom‐up and cannot be specified a priori. The virtual competency exhibited by individuals can be the key to overcoming the constraints of knowledge transfers with such characteristics because underlying competency can facilitate effective action in unfamiliar and novel situations. In this conceptual research, we develop a theoretical model of individual virtual competence and describe its role in the communication process, which underpins effective knowledge transfer in virtual settings. Additionally, we consider the antecedent role that prior experience in virtual activity plays in aiding workers to develop virtual competence, which in turn engenders effective knowledge transfer. We conclude with implications for future research and for practicing managers.},

Business networks are underpinned by the firms' resources, social legitimacy and associated power, which are also seen in the adoption theories of business‐to‐business integration (B2Bi) in the supply chain. However, there appears to be scarcity of the discussion on the theoretical relationship between them. This paper aims to enrich the previous findings of technology adoption theories in a business‐to‐business context by proposing a structural model and using Structural Equation Modelling approach to test it. It focuses on the integrated supply chain to test, analyse and extend the adoption factors to the use of computer‐based information systems (IS). The survey data were collected in the Taiwanese Information Technology Industry. The path analyses indicate the answers for three issues raised from the research framework and confirm the associations between a firm's existing system support readiness and the network determinants outside organizational boundaries. Further, it identifies the interrelationships among these factors and indicates that some of them mediate the enterprises' behaviour on investments to increase current IS for B2Bi purposes.},

Advances in wireless technology have increased the number of people using mobile devices and accelerated the rapid development of mobile service (m‐service) conducted with these devices. However, although many companies are today making considerable investments to take advantage of the new business possibilities offered by wireless technology, research on mobile commerce suggests potential consumers may not adopt these m‐services in spite of their availability. Thus, there is a need for research to identify the factors that affect consumer intention to use m‐services. Based on the technology acceptance model (TAM), theory of planned behaviour (TPB) and Luarn & Lin's 2005 mobile banking acceptance model, the current research respecifies and validates an integrated model for predicting consumer intention to use m‐service by adding one trust‐related construct (‘perceived credibility’) and two resource‐related constructs (‘self‐efficacy’ and ‘perceived financial resources’) to the TAM's nomological structure and re‐examining the relationships between the proposed constructs. Data collected from 258 users in Taiwan were tested against the research model using the structural equation modelling approach. The results strongly support the proposed model in predicting consumer intention to use m‐service. Several implications for information technology/information system acceptance research and m‐service management practices are discussed.},

Although information systems and technology (IS/IT) investments have always caused varying degrees of business change, the main purpose of many of today’s IS/IT implementations is to change the business and/or organization in some significant way. However, most organizations’ approaches to managing IS/IT developments have changed little in the last 15–20 years and are heavily dependent on methodologies of IS/IT development and associated project management principles. The philosophy being adopted by many organizations today is that there are few IS/IT projects (some infrastructure investments only) that do not cause business changes and therefore they are really ‘business projects involving IS/IT’. This exploratory research set out to devise a new framework for ‘IT and change’ management, which is more appropriate to today’s realities than traditional approaches. The initial framework was derived from ‘first principles’, then adapted and further developed by applying and testing it in a range of real projects in organizations. This paper summarizes the results of that work.},

These teams are geographically distributed and communicate via computer‐mediated communication systems (CMCS), and may never or rarely meet face‐to‐face. Relational links among team members have been found to be a significant contributor to the effectiveness of information exchange in the use of CMCS. In most cases, team members receive little or no training to improve the effectiveness of this form of communication. When training is used, it often focuses on software utilization skills, not on interpersonal communication dynamics. This paper discusses the effect of virtual team communication training on group interactions, especially for enhancing these relational links and thereby improving communication and information exchange in virtual teams. It was found that teams that were given appropriate training exhibited improved perceptions of the interaction process over time, specifically with regard to trust, commitment and frank expression between members. Discussion of the role of training on virtual team processes and outcomes is discussed and future research implications are presented.},

In this paper a case study is presented in which a mail order company made an attempt to implement a well‐known methodology, Structured Systems Analysis and Design Methodology (SSADM). Far from facilitating the development process, SSADM encouraged a rigid and mechanical approach in which the methodology was applied in a ritualistic way which inhibited creative thinking. The argument is thus, that methodology, although its influence may be benign, has the potential to operate as a ‘social defence’, i.e. as a set of organizational rituals with the primary function of containing anxiety. The grandiose illusion of an all‐powerful method allows practitioners to deny their feelings of impotence in the face of the daunting technical and political challenges of systems development. By withdrawing into this fantasy world the learning processes that are critical to the success of systems development are jeopardized. Methodology, whilst masquerading as the epitome of rationality, may thus operate as an irrational ritual, the enactment of which provides designers with a feeling of security and efficiency at the expense of real engagement with the task at hand.},

The term ‘complex informated domain’ refers to a work environment characterized by high complexity and onerous cognitive demands, in which the management of a remote process is mediated by an information system (IS). Such work environments are typical of highly technical domains, such as industrial process control, but as computer‐based information systems penetrate ever deeper into modern businesses, all organizations are taking on the same ‘informated’ characteristics. This paper reports an experiment using a rich simulation (‘a microworld’), which attempted to throw light on human–machine dynamics in such complex environments. Two issues were investigated: the state of the subject (fatigue induced by sleep loss) and the degree of operator control (empowerment) afforded by the IS interface. Results showed that sleep deprivation led to no degradation in overt performance but, contrary to expectations, lower performance was associated with high control operation. A detailed qualitative analysis showed the high control interface to encourage a more proactive control style, whereas fatigue intensified primitive, reactive strategies. The findings emphasize that cognition is a goal‐directed, adaptive system not simply an information‐processing mechanism. A model of cognitive dynamics is outlined that distinguishes a hierarchy of control levels: anxiety defences, reactive control and strategic control. In general, the experiment shows the potential value to IS research of the microworld paradigm as a tool for developing theory and exploring key design issues.},

We posit instead that boundaries are a dynamic phenomenon and may have different consequences under different circumstances. We offer organisational discontinuity theory as a tool for more focused investigation of the virtual work environment. Discontinuities and continuities describe the setting in which individuals in a virtual team operate, both actual work practices and the perceptions of the individuals in the virtual work environment. The terms offer a starting point to identify and understand what may otherwise seem to be paradoxical differences in how virtual team members respond to boundaries.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. Nijssen's Information Analysis Method ( niam ) provides a powerful grammar for generating conceptual schema diagrams. We evaluate this grammar systematically using an ontological model proposed by Bunge, Wand and Weber. Our analysis shows niam 'Sgrammar has many desirable features. Nevertheless, we conclude it is deficient in three respects. First, we argue that construct overload occurs in niam 'Sgrammar. Multiple real‐world features are represented by the same grammatical construct in niam . As a result, we predict users of niam will sometimes be confused about which characteristics of the real world are being represented by niam 'Soverloaded grammatical constructs. Second, we argue that construct redundancy occurs in niam . Multiple grammatical constructs can be used to represent the same real‐world feature. As a result, we predict users of niam will choose to employ only one of the grammatical constructs provided to represent a particular real‐world feature. Alternatively, they will equivocate in their choice of a grammatical construct and thus undermine their effectiveness and efficiency in using niam . Third, we argue niam has construct deficit. Some ontological constructs have no corresponding grammatical construct in niam . As a result, we predict users of niam will employ other grammars to represent real‐world features that cannot be represented by niam 'Sgrammar. We predict that using multiple grammars to represent real‐world features, however, will evoke other problems associated with attaining consistent representations among the scripts generated via the grammars.},

Maintaining control of the location of persons with dementia is a major source of caregiver burden, and assistive technologies such as smart locating systems hold the promise of enhancing quality of life and reducing caregiver burden. Drawing from research on smart service systems, organizational configuration research, and practice theory, we articulate a conceptual model of configuring in practice to explain how practice elements and the capabilities of smart technologies become mutually configured. Our analysis of study participants' experiences with the locating systems identified three distinctive configurations, characterized as enhanced smartness, degraded smartness, and fragile smartness, which developed through configuring processes. The configuring in practice model we develop here helps explain why unexpected and anticipated configurations develop and thus the conditions that facilitate or inhibit value cocreation in smart service systems.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. The expansion of global firms, supported by extensive information and communication technology (ICT) systems, is frequently seen as leading to the spread of best practices to different regions of the world. Some argue that these practices are bound up with the national origins of these firms, while others propose that local circumstances in specific economies are of prime importance. According to the first perspective, global firms will use ICTs in China that reflect their national origins, but the second approach emphasizes the importance of the Chinese local context in how and what ICTs are used. Based on evidence from two case studies of global UK multinationals with Chinese joint ventures, this paper argues that the ICTs used by these companies do relate to their national roots and that China is seen by them as a very unusual setting that is treated as a special case. For example, one company was prepared to roll out a global enterprise planning system elsewhere but refused to implement it in China, while the second company cordoned off their ICT systems in China from their other, more global systems. Cultural frames of reference are advanced as an important explanation of differences in the usage of ICTs in China. Building on these ideas, this paper argues that how difference is recognized, accommodated and (re)affirmed is significant for the performance of formal business processes. Formal and ICT‐enabled systems ‘work’ by being embedded in changing Chinese cultural practices such as guanxi , though this is frequently not recognized by Western managers. While the global nature of global firms may be overplayed, the local arrangements of joint ventures are very important in how ICT systems are implemented in which the embedding and disembedding require an understanding of sited cultural practices that underpin the performance of formal systems. What is at stake is how global firms and their ICT systems are able to adapt to Chinese circumstances, and, in the longer term, how Chinese joint venture partners, often previously state‐owned enterprises, adapt to different forms of control mediated by ICTs.},

Previous studies have firmly established the technological gatekeeper to be a key node in the innovation process – acquiring, translating and disseminating novel information throughout the R&D social network. Drawing on social network analysis and interview evidence from a software R&D group, we find that the gatekeeper role has undergone a division of labour. Theoretically, we contribute to the body of knowledge by developing an updated technological gatekeeper conceptual framework. For practitioners, we identify the competencies exhibited by the small number of communication specialists who are largely responsible for diffusing novel information. We then advise practitioners how to maximise the contribution of these ‘stars’ to the information flow network.},

It first highlights 10 common problem areas that can be addressed. It then focuses on evaluation at the critical feasibility stage of projects and identifies from the research a number of ways in which evaluation practice can be improved. It finds a fall‐off in evaluation at subsequent project stages, little attempt to link evaluation across the lifetime of systems, and a fragmented approach to learning from the evaluation experience for future investments. A number of modern alternatives to traditional financially based investment appraisal techniques that dominate the sample are then critically assessed. Tailored to specific organizational circumstances and projects these offer ways forward. Broader thinking, in terms of Information Systems (IS) investments, and a deeper understanding of IS as human activity systems lead on to multiple effectiveness criteria and related measures. However, major improvements may lie in allying more appropriate techniques and measures to developing evaluation as an organizational and social process, with the deeper organizational learning about IT this would entail.},

   abstract                      = {Although employee computer abuse is a costly and significant problem for firms, the existing academic literature regarding this issue is limited. To address this gap, we apply a multi‐theoretical model to explain employees' intentions to abuse computers. To understand the motives for such behaviour, we investigate the role of two forms of organizational justice – distributive and procedural – both of which provide explanations of how perceptions of unfairness are created in the organizational context. By applying deterrence theory, we also examine the extent to which formal sanctions influence and moderate the intentions to abuse computers. Finally, we examine how the potential motives for abuse may be moderated by techniques of neutralization, which allow offenders to justify their actions and absolve themselves of any associated feelings of guilt and shame. Utilizing the scenario‐based factorial survey method for our experimental design, we empirically evaluated the association between these antecedents and the behavioural intention to violate Information systems (IS) security policies in an environment where the measurement of actual behaviour would be impossible. Our findings suggest that individual employees may form intentions to commit computer abuse if they perceive the presence of procedural injustice and that techniques of neutralization and certainty of sanctions moderate this influence. The implications of these findings for research and practice are presented. © 2016 John Wiley & Sons Ltd},

In this article, we consolidate insights from previous research to conceptualize technology renewal as an inherently paradoxical digital transformation process that requires organizations to simultaneously remove their technological foundation and build on the practices that depend on it to implement a new technological foundation. Previous research suggests that technology renewal initiatives are driven by three paradoxical tensions: (a) established vs renewed technology usage, (b) deliberate vs emergent renewal practices and (c) inner vs outer renewal contexts. We apply this framing to a longitudinal case study in which we analyse and explain how an organization's responses to manifestations of these tensions eventually led to a vicious cycle of continued investments into two overlapping and largely incompatible digital platforms over a 9‐year period. Based on these conceptual and empirical insights, we theorize technology renewal as a paradoxical, and increasingly critical, digital transformation process that forces managers to make decisions in complex and ambiguous choice situations.},

One potential remedy for these shortages is to focus more attention on historically underrepresented groups. We explore ways organizations can support ethnic minority IT professionals to enhance their career success. Integrating affective, cognitive and social perspectives through affective events theory and social exchange theory, our objective is to explore the implications of ethnic minority status for the relationship between leader support (i.e., mentoring and leader–member exchange (LMX)) and subjective and objective indicators of career success (i.e., organizational commitment and merit pay) among IT workers. To test the model, we conducted a field study of 289 IT workers in a Fortune 500 company. Our results showed that LMX influenced organizational commitment for ethnic minorities, while career mentoring and LMX influenced organizational commitment for majorities. Psychosocial mentoring influenced merit pay for ethnic minorities, while neither LMX nor mentoring influenced merit pay for majorities. Our study contributes to the literature on IT personnel issues by exploring how and why these leader support mechanisms enhance organizational commitment and merit pay for IT workers. Moreover, we demonstrate that ethnicity is an important consideration for researchers studying organizational commitment, merit pay, mentoring and LMX. Our findings suggest that managers can boost organizational commitment among IT workers by focusing on LMX and career mentoring. Moreover, they may want to place particular emphasis on psychosocial mentoring and interventions to enhance LMX for their ethnic minority IT workers.},

Recent incidents have shown that the perpetrators of cybercrimes are using increasingly sophisticated methods. Hence, it is necessary to investigate non‐traditional mechanisms, such as biological techniques, to manage the security of evolving eBusiness networks and services. Towards this end, this paper investigates the use of an Artificial Immune System (AIS). The AIS emulates the mechanism of human immune systems that save human bodies from complex natural biological attacks. The paper discusses the use of AIS on one aspect of security management, viz. the detection of credit card fraud. The solution is illustrated with a case study on the management of frauds in credit card transactions, although this technique may be used in a range of security management applications in eBusiness.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. The use of computers in organizations has often been justified by reference to the ‘improved decision‐making’ which will result from the use of new technology. Rarely, if ever, is any precise measurement given as to how such improvements will be judged. Phrases such as ‘better information leads to better decisions’ and ‘what managers require is more information’ dominate the literature on management information systems (MIS). Alistair Preston argues that this alignment with top management allowed MIS to legitimize and elevate itself as both a serious practice and an academic discipline. The two dominant themes in the relationship between information technology (IT) and managerial decision‐making have been the use of Herbert Simon's work on decision‐making and Anthony's pyramidal structure of types of application system, the latter model leading to a powerful categorization of types of computer‐based information systems (i.e. transaction processing, management information systems, decision support systems, executive information systems). The models of decision‐making employed at each level of this hierarchy are those characterized by Simon as ‘objective rationality’ and ‘bounded rationality’ and these models encourage a view of information as representing some objective reality which can be captured, stored and processed within some form of technology. Dick Boland has argued forcibly that Simon's work has been crucial to the current level of understanding of information and technology within organizations. Less concern has been given, however, to the role which IT itself plays in reinforcing this rationalistic view of information and decision‐making. As Mitroff has pointed out, to represent (or model) a problem is to conduct an inquiry into its nature. Likewise, Dick Boland suggests that information technologies are themselves social inventions that are malleable and shaped during use but that such sets limits and opens possibilities that shape the users as well. Hence, information technologies both incorporate and give rise to changes in our vocabularies for knowing ourselves and our institutions. It will not be enough, therefore, for us merely to change our existing models of managerial decision‐making, it will also be necessary to design new technologies which will reflect and encourage the use of such models. In this paper we shall use the framework provided by Mitroff to try to consider a number of different paradigms of inquiring system and to see what technological forms would need to be developed in order that we may provide technological support for individual decision‐making based on each paradigm.},

In this paper, we explain the roots of the concept and its six constituent elements at the individual, organizational, and ecosystem levels. These elements are then abstracted into two dimensions: (a) spiritual idealism and (b) perpetual development. We argue that Qinghuai as a concept is a product and reflection of the cultural and institutional complexity of contemporary China. Further, we discuss how Qinghuai facilitates digital entrepreneurship across the business, organizational, and technological domains. This explanation is substantiated by data from our three cases and juxtaposed with what has been discussed in the existing digital entrepreneurship literature. Finally, as we present the contributions of our study, we elaborate on (a) how Qinghuai reflects the contemporary context of China; (b) how Qinghuai is instrumental to digital entrepreneurship in China; and (c) how Qinghuai is different from other related concepts including Guanxi, collectivism, collective action and social entrepreneurship.

However, the effects of user perceptions of these 3 functional roles are largely unknown. We advance Fogg's framework by developing a conceptual model to explain how a feature of a computing technology (ie, the trade‐off transparency feature of a recommendation agent [RA], which interactively demonstrates the trade‐offs among product attribute values) can result in certain outcomes by shaping the beliefs of individuals regarding the 3 functional roles. We examine the effects of the perceived Functional Triad on the following 3 outcomes: (1) persuading users to use an RA (intention to use), (2) persuading users to follow the advice of the RA (recommendation adherence), and (3) persuading users to recommend the RA to others (recommendation to friends). We conducted a laboratory experiment to manipulate 4 levels of trade‐off transparency, thereby creating an adequate amount of variations for the perceived Functional Triad. A total of 160 participants were recruited from a large university in North America. Although designers could control the technology design aspects, these designs may not accomplish the intended effects on users, who have their own perceptions.

This study proposes a social contingency model in which a rules‐oriented ethical climate (employee perception of a rules‐adherence environment) at the organizational level and susceptibility to interpersonal influence (employees observing common practices via peer interactions) at the individual level interact with both command‐and‐control and self‐regulatory approaches to affect ISP compliance. Using employee survey data, we found that these two social influence factors weaken the effects of both command‐and‐control and self‐regulatory approaches on ISP compliance.

Our study develops a sensemaking model for technology‐vendor selection that connects the multiple rounds of client‐vendor communicative actions with the client's sensemaking process. We show how the client reconciles fragmented and sometimes conflicting cues and information through three intertwined cycles: immediate, retrospective, and decision. Sensebreaking occurs as a separate process (and not a communicative action) when disruptive cues occur persistently and from different vendors over multiple rounds of sensemaking. We derive a set of critical factors, on the basis of the sensemaking perspective, for selecting an appropriate vendor and technical solution. These insights in turn help explain many poorly executed IS procurement decisions.},

   abstract                      = {Abstract. We develop a process model of post‐merger knowledge sharing based on distributed cognition, a systems perspective and path dependence. The framework conceptualizes knowledge sharing by layers of management choice and employee appropriation of knowledge resources seen as knowledge as content and knowledge as connection. We use the framework to study a merger of two polymer companies. The study reveals that mergers represent a discontinuity in knowledge sharing. Yet, chosen strategies often mirror the learned knowledge‐sharing practices of one of the merged companies and match poorly with the post‐merger knowledge‐sharing needs. Five factors emerged contribute to this knowledge gap: (a) the nature of the merger; (b) a lack of shared context; (c) the incompatibility of existing knowledge systems; (d) the tacit dimension of knowledge; and (e) time pressures of the merger. Our study shows that, employees enacted knowledge new sharing practices that differed significantly from the official strategy to close to the post‐merger knowledge gap.},

Within this manuscript is depicted a process model of how ICT tools can be used for human development through emancipatory pedagogy, ie, the communication of knowledge in a way that promotes critical reflection and collective action. Combining interpretive and critical methods, I describe how the Klamath's ICT reflected the emancipatory journey of those creating it and empowered the Klamath to lead ICT users toward emancipation. An interpretive approach revealed that ICT framing tools promoted awareness of the Klamath, awareness of the problem the Klamath sought to address, and awareness of societal systems of power that enforced the Klamath's problem, while ICT tactic tools enabled “the aware” to engage in solutions. Notably, the Klamath shirked prevailing practices in ICT for development. Consistent with my critical approach, I use the Klamath case to suggest normative recommendations for the use of ICT for social good.},

This paper deals with the architecture and cooperation mechanism of web‐based agile manufacturing cells. Based on an analysis of structure and organization requirements of agile manufacturing cells and a comparison of three basic architectures of manufacturing systems, the quasi‐heterarchical architecture is used for the agile manufacturing cell. Functional layers are defined in this architecture to make the cell's control system reconfigurable and reusable. Agent technology is adopted for implementation of each layer's functions to establish an agent‐based model of agile manufacturing cells. Four types of agents including cooperation agent, job management agent, resource broker agent, and resource control agent are defined, and their functions discussed. Finally, a real time interaction mechanism of the agents is presented by considering the activities during the agents’ cooperation in an agile manufacturing cell.},

Considering recent technological advances in software and hardware and our history of helping address wicked challenges, we believe the time is ripe to mobilise IS scholarship for a CE. Our findings from an interdisciplinary literature review show that research has primarily examined IS potentials for increasing efficiency of isolated intra‐organisational processes while neglecting the larger sustainability potential of IS to establish circular material flows—that is, slow down and close material loops across entire product lifecycles. In response, we propose directions for IS research that develop our knowledge of how IS can help understand and enact circular material flows to intensify and extend use of products and components and recycle waste materials. Our directions offer pathways to building and evaluating the problem‐solution pairing that could characterise a prolific CE‐IS relationship.},

Export‐focused small and medium‐sized enterprises (SMEs) in China face a number of barriers to success, two primary ones being the liability of foreignness and resource scarcity. In order to transcend these challenges and be able to survive/prosper in the hypercompetitive international market, where players include large resourceful multinational organizations with experience in varied national contexts, these firms need to develop different organizational capabilities. In this paper, we specifically examine the role of a key organizational capability – information technology (IT) capability – and its different dimensions, in determining performance of export‐focused SMEs in China. Our study reveals that IT capability has a positive impact on such firms' performance. This finding indicates the need for their owners/managers to invest in IT capability. Further, the study also highlights specific sub‐dimensions of IT capability that export‐focused Chinese SMEs should (or should not) develop, so as to derive maximum performance‐related gains for the minimum amount spent on IT.},

Results indicate that environmental factors such as information intensity, and firm‐level factors such as international entrepreneurial orientation, prompt born‐global firms to develop IT capability. Further, our results also strongly emphasise the positive role that IT capability plays on the performance of born‐global firms. Finally, a comparative analysis of the Chinese and US born‐global firms revealed a lack of a cross‐cultural difference in the factors leading these firms to develop IT capability, therefore supporting the ‘convergence’ perspective in cross‐cultural research.},

The results indicated that psychological ownership is an important mental state for sponsors in crowdfunding, which significantly affects their commitment to projects.

However, hardly anything is known about the attitudes that onshore colleagues hold towards offshoring, and how such offshoring attitudes affect relational behaviours towards offshore colleagues. We therefore present an interpretivist, qualitative case study that explores the offshoring attitudes of German information technology developers. We found that offshoring attitudes affected relational behaviours towards Indian offshore colleagues, in terms of (1) treating Indian colleagues as fellow team members as opposed to suppliers; (2) spending more or less effort in communication and knowledge transfer; and (3) supporting vs. avoiding the task transfer. These relational behaviours fed back into participants' offshoring attitudes, leading to vicious and virtuous circles. The circles created two contrasting configurations of offshoring attitudes and relational behaviours, driven by opposing forces within the departmental context. Our findings highlight the value of taking a configurational perspective for understanding offshoring success and for identifying drivers that need to be managed in order to achieve favourable configurations. We suggest that future research should further expand the typology of attitude‐behaviour configurations and could apply theories of efficacy, self‐reinforcing spirals and planned behaviour.},

However, only a few studies in IS research have explicitly examined the role of social capital for knowledge transfer in an IT offshoring context. In this paper, we argue that such knowledge transfer mechanisms can be understood better by considering social capital in concert with knowledge senders' efficacy and outcome expectations, two of the potentially key motivational drivers of knowledge transfer. We develop our arguments through a qualitative case study of a large German multinational company. German IT developers in this firm provided in‐depth accounts of their experience with offshore colleagues in an Indian captive subsidiary unit. Drawing on our analysis, we develop a model that depicts the influence of social capital, efficacy and outcome expectations on onshore IT developers' ability and willingness to transfer knowledge to offshore colleagues. Through the model, we also explain how social capital, efficacy and outcome expectations are interrelated and generate three interlocked, self‐reinforcing circles of knowledge transfer success in IT offshoring relationships.},

A framework is developed to distinguish actual from perceived misfits. This is used to analyse the ERP implementation at four small‐sized and medium‐sized enterprises. The results show that they prefer to adjust the ERP system to their business processes when needed but often unnecessarily change the system to solve perceived misfits. The framework is a first step to prevent this unnecessary work in the future.},

The field of communicative action‐based modelling of business processes and information systems has attracted more and more attention in recent years. Inspired by the seminal work of Winograd and Flores, researchers have proposed several modelling approaches. In this article we discuss communicative action‐based modelling approaches in general and the DEMO (dynamic essential modelling of organizations) approach in particular. Besides establishing the theoretical foundations of this modelling approach, we also apply DEMO to a case study, and we discuss how the resulting models can be used for information systems design and business process optimization.},

The enactment of control often fails in practice; however, as controlee perceptions may not match those of controllers, leading to a myriad of possible outcomes. Through an interpretive case study of two inter‐organisational IT projects, we reveal how controlees' appraisals and responses to controls are context‐dependent and play out across multiple levels (e.g., personal, professional, project and organisational contexts). We build on a coping perspective of IS controls to theorise the ‘coping strategies’ that controlees pursued relevant to these contexts and the ‘coping routes’ followed when combining different consecutive coping strategies. We find the process need not end with the selection of a single strategy but can potentially continue as both the controller and controlees make ongoing readjustments. While Behavioural Control Theory traditionally assumes the presence of a single control hierarchy, interorganisational IT projects are multi‐level entities that amalgamate different structures and cultures. Our study moves beyond the existing assumptions of Behavioural Control Theory to discuss how a controller's choice of activities shapes the salience of different contexts in controlee appraisals.},

   abstract                      = {Although off‐the‐shelf enterprise systems (ES) have been widely adopted in organisations, the extant literature repeatedly documents ES failures caused by misfits between organisational processes and the ES. Although some misfits can be identified early in the ES lifecycle, others emerge in the onward and upward phase (i.e., after the implementation) and, hence, must be resolved reactively. Prior research on misfits and resolution strategies has primarily focused on the implementation phase, often assuming that close‐to‐perfect information on the misfit's nature and characteristics is available. However, no study has examined how to effectively complete a shared diagnosis and resolution of misfits when diverging individual user perceptions are taken as the starting point. Such situations may be particularly pronounced in pluralistic organisations, where a variety of interdependent processes and potentially competing perceptions of processes are prevalent. The main objective of this study is to address this gap. To this end, we propose a pragmatic method for the diagnosis and resolution of misfits between organisational processes and enterprise systems, which builds on an actionable conceptualization of misfits. This method builds on theoretical concepts of affordances, affordance actualization, user participation, and change agentry. To demonstrate the feasibility and effectiveness of the proposed method, we conducted an action research study in a university hospital. Our analysis focused on a specific misfit involving the hospital's ES‐supported clinical processes. The findings suggest that the method effectively diagnoses and resolves misfits and optimises the resources required for their resolution through efficient management of user participation. We conclude with a discussion of the theoretical and practical contributions of our work.},

We adopt a theory‐infused interventionist research approach to assist a pre‐digital multinational military organisation in navigating its digital transformation (DT) by focusing on IQ. We design and implement an IQ strategy (IQS) by drawing upon organisational information processing theory and examining how the level of IQ can affect the balance between information processing requirements and capacity. We demonstrate that an IQS that incorporates both technological, as well as IQ governance solutions, can support organisations in setting the scope of their DT, decreasing employees' resistance to change, and increasing their satisfaction, while concurrently improving organisational efficiency. Our work stresses the importance of IQ in the digital era and delineates how pre‐digital organisations can navigate DT by strategically addressing IQ.},

A review of the information systems literature, however, reveals a narrow focus on technology‐enabled business benefits. Scant research attention has been paid to the role of humans and humanistic outcomes. To spur new research addressing these issues, formalised affordance theory is employed to develop a new 4IR conceptualization. Four groupings of affordances that capture salient 4IR action possibilities are developed within two categories: machine emulation of human cognition (expansive decision‐making and creativity automation) and machine emulation of human communication (relationship with humans and intermachine teaming). Implications are explored in the context of human‐machine coworking and the development of artificial intelligence safety regulations. Overall, the affordance conceptualization of the 4IR advances a new sociotechnical lexicon of action possibilities and their joint enactment in achieving humanistic and instrumental outcomes, enabling alignment of the scope of 4IR research with the scope of 4IR phenomena—and bringing humans back into the loop.},

To this end, we analysed fact‐checked tweets from political elites, tweets from media outlets and replies to those tweets. Together, these tweets received more than 100 000 replies and were shared more than two million times. We also conducted two online experiments. Our field studies reveal that misinformation and extreme partisan information are associated with higher levels of negative emotions and greater engagement than accurate information and non‐extreme partisan information. Our data also show that—while negative emotions in response to extreme partisan information are higher among social media users at the ideological extreme than those at the ideological centre—there is no difference in the two groups' level of negative emotions in response to misinformation. The online experiments demonstrate that exposure to misinformation and extreme partisan information elicits stronger negative emotions than exposure to accurate information and non‐extreme partisan information. These negative emotions, in turn, contribute to attitude polarisation.

While business analytics (BA) offers the potential to overcome these challenges, research to date offers very limited insights into how BA capabilities interact with ambidextrous capabilities to realise environmental value. We address this issue by conducting a comparative case study at a bank and at a real‐estate trust through the theoretical lens of dynamic capabilities. We develop a process model to explain how BA powers ambidextrous practices to achieve sustainability outcomes over time. We uncover two mechanisms: a BA‐powered context shaping mechanism by which BA powers contextual ambidexterity at the employee level using data availability, timeliness, and analytics culture; and a BA‐powered resource linking mechanism by which BA powers structural ambidexterity at intra‐ and inter‐organisational levels using holistic insights and analytics leadership. Our model highlights the contextual factors that condition the extent to which a firm moves along the continuum of exploration–exploitation. We also define a new dimension of sustainability outcomes which we label eco‐awareness to explain how BA shapes employees' environmental alertness and enables the paradigm shift in an organisation's sustainability mindset.},

In particular, boundary resources that are the interface between the platform and complementors need to be well‐designed to attract complementors and keep them engaged. We propose that lead complementor involvement helps incumbent companies to improve the design of the platform boundary resources. In a multi‐year action research study, we established lead complementor involvement in the boundary resource design of a digital platform for automotive onboard apps at the BMW Group and evaluated how boundary resources improved. Along three episodes, we illustrate that lead complementor involvement was effective and we summarise our findings in four propositions: (1) lead complementor involvement facilitates platform emergence for incumbent companies by enhancing boundary resource design, (2) lead complementor involvement is more efficient in higher platform layers, (3) lead complementor involvement is facilitated by an increase of intensity and frequency of interactions between complementors and platform owner and (4) establishing a complementor community helps to continuously identify opportunities for lead complementor involvement. We contribute to the information systems literature on platform emergence and design by focusing on the process of designing boundary resources and by considering the heterogeneity of complementors. Furthermore, we contextualise the concept of lead user involvement in the domain of digital platforms and compare and contrast lead complementors and lead users.},

   abstract                      = {Online extremism remains a persistent problem despite the best efforts of governments, tech companies and civil society. Digital technologies can induce group polarization to promote extremism and cause substantial changes to extremism (e.g., create new forms of extremism, types of threats or radicalization approaches). Current methods to counter extremism induce undesirable side‐effects (e.g., ostracize minorities, inadvertently promote extremism) or do not leverage the full potential of digital technologies. Extremism experts recognize the need for researchers from other disciplines, like information systems, to contribute their technical expertise for understanding and countering online extremism. This article aims to introduce the field of information systems to the issue of online extremism. Information systems scholars address technology‐related societal issues from a sociotechnical perspective. The sociotechnical perspective describes systems through a series of interactions between social (structure, people) and technical components (physical system, task). We apply the sociotechnical perspective to (1) summarize the current state‐of‐the‐art knowledge of 222 articles in a systematic multi‐disciplinary literature review and (2) propose specific research questions that address two questions (How do digital technologies augment extremism? How can we successfully counter online extremism?).},

Following a qualitative research design, this paper uses 675 forum interactions collected across six online communities. Based on our findings, we propose the concept of professional holding environments and provide a model for building such holding environments and job crafting in online communities. We thereby expand previous research on holding environments comprised of family members and friends by revealing the impact of professional online communities and their role in professionalisation and crafting supportive social structures in online crowd work.},

However, whereas some cybersecurity initiatives are perceived as reasonable by employees, others are viewed as a ‘waste of time’. This research introduces employee judgements of cybersecurity legitimacy as a new angle for understanding employee compliance with cybersecurity policies over time. Drawing on theory from the organisational legitimacy and cybersecurity literature, we conduct a three‐wave survey of 529 employees and find that, for each separate wave, negative legitimacy judgements mediate the relationship between management support and compliance, as well as between cybersecurity inconvenience and compliance. Our results provide support for cybersecurity legitimacy as an important influence on employee compliance with cybersecurity initiatives. This is significant because it highlights to managers the importance of not simply expecting compliant employee behaviour to follow from the introduction of cybersecurity initiatives, but that employees need to be convinced that the initiatives are fair and reasonable. Interestingly, we did not find sufficient support for our expectation that the increased likelihood of a cybersecurity incident will moderate the legitimacy‐policy compliance relationship. This result suggests that the legitimacy perceptions of employees are unyielding to differences in the risk characteristics of the cybersecurity incidents facing organisations.},

With advances in user interface technologies, many e‐tailers have started to offer gamified monetary reward designs (MRDs), which require visitors to earn the monetary reward by playing a game, rather than simply claiming the reward. However, little is known about whether and why gamified MRDs engage visitors compared to their non‐gamified counterpart. Even less is known about the effectiveness of gamified MRDs when providing certain or chance‐based rewards, in that visitors do or do not know what reward they will gain for successfully performing in the game. Drawing on cognitive evaluation theory, we investigate gamified MRDs with certain or chance‐based rewards and contrast them to non‐gamified MRDs with certain rewards in user registration systems. Our results from a multi‐method approach encompassing the complementary features of a randomised field experiment ( N = 651) and a randomised online experiment ( N = 330) demonstrate differential effects of the three investigated MRDs on user registration. Visitors encountering either type of gamified MRD are more likely to register than those encountering a non‐gamified MRD. Moreover, gamified MRDs with chance‐based rewards have the highest likelihood of user registrations. We also show that MRDs have distinct indirect effects on user registration via anticipated experiences of competence and sensation. Overall, the paper offers theoretical insights and practical guidance on how and why gamified MRDs are effective for e‐tailers.},

This research advances understanding on how to develop DR, drawing on insights from an Action Design Research (ADR) study conducted during the COVID‐19 pandemic. Our research explores a particular facet of DR: the capacity to manage exogenous shocks through the design of new IS solutions. We introduce the ADAPT framework, comprising five key enablers—Agility, Designation, Alignment, Participation, and Trust—recommended to support design teams developing IS solutions during and for crises. Our ADR project, which resulted in the creation of a telemonitoring system used by over 115 frontline healthcare workers to monitor the symptoms of more than 1000 COVID‐19 patients, demonstrates the instrumental role these five enablers play in supporting a crisis‐propelled IS design process that is urgent, resource‐limited, and multi‐partite. By presenting new design process knowledge and practical recommendations that guide crisis‐driven IS design, we aim to equip design teams with the understanding they need to effectively navigate similar challenges in the future. We also hope to inspire and support IS researchers to apply their expertise in the design, deployment, and use of IS solutions to contribute to crisis‐driven design endeavours that tackle the pressing and urgent challenges of our time.},

   abstract                      = {Opinion polarisation in social media has recently become a significant issue. The existing literature mainly attributes polarisation to online friends' informational social influence, that is, users are more likely to interact with others with similar opinions, which leads to the echo chamber effect. However, the impact of social interaction on individual polarisation may also result from normative social influence, which varies with social settings on the platform. In this paper, we leverage a quasi‐experiment to investigate the normative social influence of online friends on focal users' review polarity. We use fixed effects and difference‐in‐differences approaches, along with propensity score matching, to address the potential endogeneity in users' friend function adoption decisions. Our results indicate that adopting the friend function leads users to post less extreme ratings. We further separate the reviews into positive and negative, finding that the reduction in the review polarity for positive reviews is more prominent than for negative ones. Regarding user heterogeneity, our causal forest analysis uncovers that users with a higher engagement level on the platform are less affected by adopting the friend function than those with less engagement. Our study has clear implications for managers and platform designers, highlighting the importance of social function design in reducing social media induced polarisation.},

To do so, we draw from information systems research on digital government and platforms for development, complemented with governance theory from political science and conduct an interpretive in‐depth case study of an urban reporting platform in Montevideo called ‘Por Mi Barrio’. The study reveals three mutually reinforced orders of governance in the trajectory of the project and explain how the collaboration unfolded over time: (i) a technical decision to use open platform architectures; (ii) the negotiation of formal and informal rules to make the project thrive and (iii) a shared, long‐term ideology around the value of open technologies and technical sovereignty grounded in years of political history. Using a contextual explanation approach, our study helps to improve our understanding on the governance of collaborative digital government platforms in Latin America, with specific contributions to practice.},

We ground our study in Parker et al. (2010) proactive motivation theory (ProMT) and develop an integrated multilevel model to examine the respective effects of proactive motivational states, that is, can‐do , reason‐to , and energised‐to motivations, on employees' proactive ISBs. We also explore the roles of individual differences and contextual factors—namely, proactive personality and supervisory ISec support—and their influences on proactive motivational states. Data were collected from 210 employees situated in 55 departments distributed among multiple organisations located in China. The results show that supervisory ISec support positively influences employees' proactive motivational states and thereby boosts employees' proactive ISBs. Proactive personality negatively moderates the effect of supervisory ISec support on flexible security role orientation (reason‐to motivation). By identifying the antecedents of employees' proactive ISBs, we make key theoretical contributions to ISec research and valuable practical contributions to organisational ISec management.},

   abstract                      = {Interactive decision aids (IDAs) on websites often require users to disclose relevant information (e.g., preferences, contact information) to help users in making decisions (e.g., product choice). With technological advances in IDAs, websites increasingly switch from static, non‐conversational IDAs (e.g., web forms) to conversational ones (e.g., chatbots) to boost user information disclosure that nurtures the websites' economic viability. While this novel form of IDAs is already widely employed in practice, information systems research has yet to examine the defining dialogue design features of conversational IDAs and their effects on eliciting user information. Drawing on persuasion theory and particularly on consistency and reciprocity as influence techniques, we develop a research model around two crucial dialogue design features of conversational IDAs. Specifically, we investigate the distinct and joint effects of conversational style (i.e., absence vs. presence of a conversational presentation of requests) and reciprocation triggers (i.e., absence vs. presence of reciprocity‐inducing information) on user information disclosure (i.e., email addresses). By combining the complementary properties of a randomised field experiment ( N = 386) and a follow‐up online experiment ( N = 182), we empirically provide evidence in support of the distinct and joint effects of conversational style and reciprocation triggers of IDAs on user information disclosure. Moreover, we demonstrate that these dialogue design features have indirect effects on information disclosure via perceptions of social presence and privacy concerns. Thus, our paper provides theoretical and practical insights into whether, how, and why critical IDA dialogue design features can better elicit user information for website services.},

Although several significant issues concerning the dynamics of digital platforms have been addressed, much of the research effort has focused on the platform owner. On the other hand, research on complementors neither takes into account the individual level nor clearly shows what an individual complementor can do to benefit from platform participation. By studying the evolving relationship between YouTube and its ecosystem of complementors (content creators), we shed light on the strategies that complementors use to progressively avoid but still benefit from platform governance. We find that content creators are, first, in a mutual relationship with the YouTube platform, benefiting from direct monetization. Then, they shift to commensalism as the relationship evolves, allowing them to avoid YouTube's governance and take advantage of multi‐homing. Our findings illuminate the effects of platform governance, particularly how it shapes the actions of complementors.},

Our analysis of video diaries and follow‐up interviews undertaken by 30 UK‐based workers reveals an ‘agentic interplay’ of hybridity and liminality that is understood as an ongoing dynamic practice, sometimes enabling and sometimes undermining desired boundary work outcomes. We make three contributions, collectively offering a critical advancement in the work–life debate and the hybridity and liminality literatures: (a) further developing an understanding of boundary work as situated, creative and dynamic; (b) unpacking the agentic potential of the ‘black box’ of the hybridity–liminality interplay; and (c) expanding current understandings and applications of the concepts of hybridity and liminality.},

By challenging these assumptions, we propose that both centralized and decentralized networks can coexist within multi‐level bimodal platforms via various role‐based subgroups with different types of decision‐makers. Livestreaming platforms, exemplifying the coexistence of multi‐level networks within a single digital ecosystem, have become increasingly popular in various industries. Drawing on social impact theory (SIT), we examine the role of information from host‐audience centralized and host–host decentralized networks in shaping subscription increment and herding effects. Using a panel dataset in livestreaming, we find that bidirectional ties in host–host networks strengthen fan acquisition and herding effect in the host‐audience decentralized network, with hosts of lower social status gaining more fans than those with higher status in bidirectional ties. Our study contributes to the understanding of social network structure, herding effect, SIT and livestreaming by problematizing assumptions and offering a contextual explanation of livestreaming. Moreover, our work provides practitioners with valuable insights into leveraging network effects for hosts' success in livestreaming.},

Prior research aimed at solving this problem has focused on factors such as task rewards and durations while overlooking whether a well‐written description might motivate solvers to choose a task. Based on signalling theory, this study investigates the effect of task descriptions on solvers' participation by focusing on informational and affective linguistic signals. Our model is validated by analysing 13 929 descriptions posted in single‐winner tasks on <jats:ext-link xmlns:xlink="http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink" xlink:href="http://epwk.com">epwk.com</jats:ext-link>, a Chinese competitive crowdsourcing platform. For informational linguistic signals, the results reveal that there are inverted U‐shaped relationships between both concreteness and specificity and solver participation, whereas linguistic accuracy has a positive effect on solver participation. For affective linguistic signals, positive emotional words have a positive relationship with solver participation, whereas negative emotional words have the opposite effect.

However, there is scant evidence as to whether orchestrating proactively induced OCB results in positive work attitudes. Our study contributes by theorising the mechanisms through which OCB fosters positive work attitudes among IT professionals, which is expected to lower their turnover rates. Grounding our research in self‐perception and self‐determination theories, we hypothesize the relationships between IT professionals' OCB and their affective attitudes towards their organisation and job, as being mediated by their cognitive evaluations of the ‘meaning of their IT work’. We test the theorised model with data collected through a large‐scale two‐wave survey design from a multinational IT‐services company.

In this research, we argue that this cannot be true because models misspecified in this way would fail the measurement validation procedures used with reflective models and thus would not be publishable. To support this argument, we present two extensive simulation studies. The simulation results show that in most cases where data originates from a formative model, estimating a reflective model would not produce results that satisfy the commonly used measurement validation guidelines. Based on these results, we conclude that widespread publication of models where the direction of measurement is misspecified is unlikely in IS and other disciplines that use similar measurement validation guidelines. Moreover, building on recent discussions on modelling endogenous formatively specified latent variables, we demonstrate that the effects of misspecification are minor in models that do pass the model quality check. Our results address important issues in the literature on the consequences of measurement model misspecification and provide a starting point for new advances in this area.},

This study investigates the key design elements of blockchain platforms and their ideal configurations for promoting user governance engagement. Due to the complex and interdependent nature of the design elements, we adopt a configurational perspective accompanied by a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) to uncover complex nonlinear relationships among key conditions that are relevant to decentralised governance. Our research identifies five key design elements that facilitate distributed governance ( Access to decision rights , Process visibility , Protocol automation , Incentives for developers/miners , and Incentives for other stakeholders ) based on existing blockchain governance literature. We analyse 14 unique blockchain platform cases that adopted on‐chain governance. Our fsQCA results reveal three ideal types of blockchain governance configurations that are sufficient for high generative user governance engagement: Centralised incentive model , Impartial incentive model , and Automation‐driven model , whereas achieving high evaluative governance engagement requires the presence of all the design elements ( Comprehensive model ). Also, we found Access to decision rights and Protocol automation are necessary conditions for generative governance engagement, and Access to decision right s together with Process visibility is a combined necessary condition for evaluative governance engagement. Relevant theoretical and practical implications for platform designers as well as methodological implications for applying QCA to emerging IS phenomena are discussed.},

The typology draws upon information manipulation theory and risk management principles to evaluate the potential impact of disinformation campaigns with respect to their virality and polarising impact. The intentionality of disinformation spread is related to its believability among susceptible consumers, who are likely to propagate the disinformation to others if they assess it to be believable. Based on the dimensions of intentionality and impact, the DII typology can be used to categorise disinformation threats and identify strategies to mitigate its risk. To illustrate its utility for evaluating the risk posted by disinformation campaigns, the DII typology is applied to a case study. We propose risk mitigation strategies as well as recommendations for addressing disinformation campaigns spread through social media platforms.},

This over‐simplistic interpretation of the TOE framework has culminated in inconsistent findings within extant literature. Considering the interdependencies among the three TOE elements in shaping organisational technology adoption and also decision‐makers' inclination to weigh the three TOE elements differently based on their strategic orientations, this study views organisational technology adoption from a systems standpoint based on a configurational approach. Particularly, we differentiate between two types of strategic orientations, namely functional orientation, which accentuates the technology‐induced efficiency gains and symbolic orientation, which stresses the image or reputation afforded through technology adoption. We advance a configurational model for organisational technology adoption that: (1) conceptualises organisational technology adoption as an outcome arising from distinct configurations of TOE elements, and; (2) extends the TOE framework by incorporating strategic orientation as an inevitable aspect of decision‐making for organisational technology adoption. To validate our proposed model, we conducted a field survey of 183 firms to collect data on their considerations underpinning organisational technology adoption before employing fuzzy‐set Qualitative Comparative Analysis to derive configurations of TOE elements responsible for driving such adoption. Analytical results reveal that the TOE configurations vary across three types of organisations (namely performance enhancer, image builder and strategic transformer). The theoretical and practical implications of our study are also discussed.},

Guided by the belief‐action‐outcome (BAO) framework, our study unveiled a process model of antecedents, belief and action formation, and outcomes specific to community‐based sustainability transformation.

The challenge of attracting employees in the context of digital transformation is leading organisations to explore drivers of commitment. Further research is needed into the key factors that bind employees to an organisation. This study seeks to advance knowledge on this individual frontier by proposing a model in which digital leadership and a continuous learning environment mediate the impact of digital transformation capabilities on organisational commitment. Testing our model through an empirical study from Spain shows an effect of both mediators. The paper thus contributes to the IS literature by identifying two mediators and their role in achieving organisational commitment. These results also suggest a new way to approach research in digital transformation by opening a new frontier on the individual level and charting a path for future study. Moreover, the results have great practical value, generating implications for organisations and new avenues of future research to explore the boundary conditions of the individual frontier.},

However, applicants do not necessarily consider an objective algorithm as fairer than a human decision maker. This study examines the conditions under which applicants perceive algorithms as fair and establishes a theoretical foundation of algorithmic fairness perceptions. We further propose and investigate transparency and anthropomorphism interventions as strategies to actively shape these fairness perceptions. In an online application scenario with eight experimental groups ( N = 801), we analyse determinants for algorithmic fairness perceptions and the impact of the proposed interventions. Embedded in a stimulus‐organism‐response framework and drawing from organisational justice theory, our study reveals four justice dimensions (procedural, distributive, interpersonal, informational justice) that determine algorithmic fairness perceptions. The results further show that transparency and anthropomorphism interventions mainly affect dimensions of interpersonal and informational justice, highlighting the importance of algorithmic fairness perceptions as critical determinants for individual choices.},

   abstract                      = {Renewing digital platforms is increasingly vital to ensure organisational performance and competitiveness. Managing such renewal is challenging, however, because it requires organisations to remove their exiting digital platform while at the same time building on the practises that depend on it in order to implement a new platform. Unfortunately, the literature offers little guidance on how to launch and manage this inherently complex process. Against this backdrop, we conducted a three‐year case study of how a local government organisation organised and managed the renewal of its digital platform, which 4000 health professionals in eldercare use on a daily basis. We use two concepts—framing and overflowing—to reflect the complexity of the process and to describe how it unfolded. Initially, managers used persuasive language to carefully frame a vision of the change and prepare platform users for the renewal process. Despite these framing efforts, however, unexpected events led to overflow situations in which events rendered the framing untenable and threatened successful renewal. This, in turn, led to a decision to postpone the new platform's go‐live date. While the postponement did defuse the situation, new overflows emerged, and management was forced to initiate further framing activities to move the platform renewal forward. Based on our insights into these events and extant literature, we present a conceptual model of framing and overflowing in organising and managing digital platform renewal that unpacks how framing–overflowing dynamics play out over time in response to the complexity of the process.},

Our primary focus is to discern dynamic patterns of complementor responses and to understand their role in the process of re‐stabilising the complementor's positioning. To this end, we conducted a 14‐year longitudinal study, analysing 21 move‐response instances across four platform partnerships. Our findings reveal three distinct complementor response archetypes: insist, pivot, and detach. Over time, complementors combine these archetypes into three unique response patterns. Through progressive diverging, complementors sidestep platform owner moves by diversifying their offer beyond the focal ecosystem. Although this can entail substantial multi‐homing costs, it reduces dependence on the platform owner and bolsters resilience against future moves. Through adaptive oscillating, complementors use platform owner moves as opportunities to gradually diversify their offer within the focal ecosystem. This stepwise market expansion makes them resilient against future moves, while mitigating costs and efforts related to multi‐homing. Through persistent insisting, complementors can re‐establish their previous positioning, but at the cost of increased dependence on the platform owner, leaving the complementor vulnerable to future moves. We synthesise these findings in our process model of complementor positioning. Emphasising the importance of complementor responses in fostering resilient software ecosystems, this model bears important implications for research on platform governance and platform‐dependent entrepreneurship.},

Our data is drawn from 36 interviews with DPC (co‐)founders, members, and experts, alongside an array of documentary data from DPCs across 12 European countries. Our analysis reveals three outcomes of social value creation by DPCs: strengthening community capacities, federating cooperative ventures, and fostering practices for narrative co‐creation. Additionally, we identify two generative mechanisms with enduring properties and explanatory power: collective identity and empowerment, and government‐community symbiosis. These mechanisms are identified through retroductive theorising, offering plausible explanations for the outcomes of social value creation, situated within relevant contextual conditions, such as grassroots mobilisation and advocacy, institutional commitment and policy support, and legislative frameworks for cooperative integration. This study contributes to the understanding of social value creation in platform cooperativism as an endeavour to co‐construct a cooperative value ecosystem, providing valuable insights for both theory and practice.},

The findings reveal that information asymmetry and persistent tensions between the government and villagers hinder cooperative behaviour in rural governance, at varying degrees throughout all stages of e‐governance. Second, a contagion effect is identified, where the government coerces non‐cooperative villagers, exacerbating tensions. The coercive and negotiating‐compromising mechanism enabled by ICT platforms illustrates how the ICT platform enables the contagion effect occurs during rural policy deployment. Third, the goal incongruence between the government and villagers necessitates the government's utilisation of ICT platforms to adopt active engagement and induce event that encourage goal articulation, which facilitates a better goal alignment between both parties. This approach promotes the observation of collaborative behaviour among villagers and ultimately fosters increased collaboration with the government, that is, mimicking villagers' behaviour. Meanwhile, government stimulation can effectively facilitate the interaction between government and villagers, promoting the negotiation and compromise between the two parties. Such compromises can foster the goal congruence between the two parties, consequently encouraging greater participation from villagers in rural governance. The case offers valuable insights into the mechanisms by which ICT facilitates rural e‐governance, thereby holding significant implications for research on ICT‐rural governance and governments grappling with challenges in implementing rural policies.},

Despite their popularity, data products are often seen as a purely technical concept, with suitable methodologies and tools for designing them still underdeveloped. This paper introduces the data product canvas, a visual and versatile tool that helps cross‐functional teams—comprising business, data, analytics and IT experts—collaboratively design new data products and assess existing ones. The canvas ensures that critical themes are addressed: desirability from the customer perspective, feasibility from the technical perspective and viability from the economic perspective. The practical application at SAP illustrates how the data product canvas supports its data democratisation initiative, showcases real‐world examples and offers practical insights to guide future adopters: (a) tailoring designs to different data product types, (b) periodically refining data products to increase their value and (c) systematically assessing requests to build a cohesive data product portfolio.},

However, LCNC platforms also pose a persistent challenge for organisations: while they offer flexibility and freedom by enabling decentralised development, they also require standardisation and control to manage risks that can be exacerbated by these platforms, such as shadow IT and technical debt. Striking the right balance is difficult—too much flexibility can compromise stability, while too much standardisation can stifle the autonomy and creativity that make LCNC platforms valuable in the first place. This study explores flexibility–standardisation tensions in LCNC development through an investigation of two multinational technology firms with differing LCNC maturity levels, both using ServiceNow. Drawing from 57 interviews, we identify three types of flexibility‐standardisation tensions shaped by three key elements of LCNC development: the platform itself, the people using the platform and the organisational processes targeted for improvement. We derive six guidelines used to navigate flexibility–standardisation tensions and demonstrate how these are applied across different stages of LCNC maturity. Building on these insights, we provide concrete, context‐sensitive recommendations to help organisations adapt the guidelines to their specific environments. We conclude with forward‐looking reflections on how firms can dynamically make sense of these tensions as LCNC platforms and practices evolve. Overall, our findings show that effective LCNC governance requires a dynamic approach—one that balances flexibility and standardisation simultaneously rather than treating them as opposing choices.},

While some customers initially resisted interacting with chatbots, the COVID‐19 outbreak caused them to reconsider. Motivated by this observation, we explore how disruptive situations, such as the COVID‐19 outbreak, stimulate customers' willingness to interact with chatbots. Drawing on the theory of consumption values, we employed interviews to identify emotional, epistemic, functional, and social values that potentially shape willingness to interact with chatbots. Findings point to six values and suggest that disruptive situations stimulate how the values influence WTI with chatbots. Following theoretical insights that values collectively contribute to behaviour, we set up a scenario‐based study and employed a fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis. We show that customers who experience all values are willing to interact with chatbots, and those who experience none are not, irrespective of disruptive situations. We show that disruptive situations stimulate the willingness to interact with chatbots among customers with configurations of values that would otherwise not have been sufficient. We complement the picture of relevant values for technology interaction by highlighting the epistemic value of curiosity as an important driver of willingness to interact with chatbots. In doing so, we offer a configurational perspective that explains how disruptive situations stimulate technology interaction.},

   abstract                      = {Political polarisation has become an increasingly alarming issue in society, exacerbated by the widespread use of social media and the development of filter bubbles among social media users. This environment has left users susceptible to disinformation, especially those with whom a user is politically aligned. In this research, we integrate truth bias, elaboration likelihood model and new media literacy into a model for explaining social media engagement (with both disinformation and factual information) and analysing how political polarisation (operationalised as political alignment between users) influences perceptions and behaviours. Using an experimental design, we analyse the model separately for posts containing disinformation and factual information, highlighting key differences. Political alignment positively moderates truth bias's effect on engagement with disinformation. For both disinformation and factual information, political alignment moderates the effect of generalised communicative suspicion (GCS) on truth bias, such that GCS's effect on truth bias flips from negative to positive as political alignment increases. Issue involvement and political alignment appear to be the primary drivers of disinformation engagement, with critical consuming media literacy failing to mitigate engagement. Our findings contribute to the understanding of persuasion, conviction, amplification, polarisation and aversion related to fake news on social media.},

Reliability is a prerequisite for validity, which assesses knowledge production. Design science research is unique in that it produces an artefact and makes contributions to a design knowledge base and is tasked with the duality of design and science. Therefore, reliability should be reconsidered to address the assumptions underlying this type of information systems research. This paper proposes a Design Science Reliability Framework. The framework identifies the part of design science research that should be evaluated (artefact, methods, measures and design knowledge). It also considers when reliability should be assessed as a project progresses by differentiating synchronic versus diachronic evaluation. The framework is used to derive a set of techniques for establishing reliability that can be applied during the evaluation process to both a project's knowledge production and its artefacts. Application of the framework should assist design science researchers when considering how to assess their results.},

   abstract                      = {ABSTRACT How security messages can be used to motivate information technology (IT) users' security behaviour has been of keen interest to IS research. To that end, studies have focused on the content of security messages; however, few studies have examined the influence of message senders. In this article, we build on social influence theory and integrate it with the concept of inferences of manipulative intent (IMI) to develop a model that examines how perceptions of sender characteristics—cybersecurity expertise, coercive power, and similarity—can yield positive and negative influence on message outcomes, captured in recipients' message compliance intentions. We test our model in four different studies using field and scenario experiments across three target populations: the general public, students, and employees. Perceived expertise, power, and similarity had similar effects among the general public and students: Perceived expertise was positively associated with message outcomes, but perceived power and similarity were negatively associated. In contrast, employees reacted differently from the general public and students in that they responded positively to perceived power, with perceived expertise and similarity having negligible effects. Across these three target populations, we found that participants reacted to senders high in perceived power and similarity with IMI, which reduced their message compliance intentions. Our results suggest that senders must be chosen carefully, depending on the target population, because selecting the wrong sender can increase the likelihood of a message being rejected.},

This study, drawing upon the resource orchestration view (ROV) and through an empirical investigation of Taiwan's COVID‐19 pandemic management, unpacked the black box process of governments leading heterogeneous societal entities to promote resource orchestration actions for the development of digital resilience. The research findings revealed four patterns of digital resource orchestrations—dual‐purposing existing IS, balancing data exploitation, enacting online co‐production, and augmenting social network effects—that led to rapid and effective pandemic crisis management in Taiwan. We incorporated our findings into a research model of digital resilience in the making, thereby providing a mechanism for building digital resilience at a societal level. The research outcomes foreground temporal and societal aspects of digital resilience that contribute to the literature by adding new insights to the currently limited research on the operational process of building digital resilience.},

Relying on an in‐depth qualitative study and the notion of two‐eyed seeing as a theoretical approach, the study focuses on the complex relationship between social media platform participation and the ways of life in a ‘Guarani’ Indigenous community in South America. This community successfully navigates tensions between participation on social media platforms and preserving their traditional ways of life. We contribute to two streams of literature. First, we contribute to the literature on digital platforms and indigeneity showing that social media use by Indigenous communities leads to specific tensions, as these communities try to balance the use of social media with their desire to preserve their ways of life and protect the natural environment and how they navigate these tensions. Second, we contribute to the literature in relation to digital platforms and non‐economic value as we unpack social and environmental value in the context of the Indigenous community and show that non‐economic value benefits multiple entities. Overall, we contribute to a deeper understanding of how Indigenous communities navigate tensions between participation on social media and their traditional way of life. Our study also offers practical insights into how policy makers and designers of social media platforms can better meet Indigenous communities' needs.},

However, their intent to engage in problem‐focused coping to meet the ISP demands and possibly reduce ISP violations has yet to be analysed. We argue that both types of coping responses coexist in employee responses to ISP demands and they together influence ISP violation intention. Drawing upon the Transactional Model of Stress and Coping, we examine how security‐related stress (SRS) triggers inward and outward emotion‐focused coping, and problem‐focused coping to the ISP demands, which together influence employee ISP violations. We also examine how ISP‐related self‐efficacy and organisational support moderate the effects of SRS on coping responses. We surveyed 200 employees in the United States to test our model. The results indicate that SRS triggers all three coping responses, and ISP‐related self‐efficacy and organisational support reduce the effects of SRS on inward and outward emotion‐focused coping. Problem‐focused coping then decreases ISP violation intention, whereas inward and outward emotion‐focused coping increases it. The model was further verified with ISP compliance as the outcome construct, which yielded consistent results. Understanding various coping responses to SRS and the factors that facilitate or inhibit the responses can assist managers in effectively designing and implementing the ISP to reduce employee ISP violations.},

Our analysis reveals that IS publications from India are relatively few in number, though increasing in recent years; hardly focussed on context‐specific issues and concerns; and are largely in lower‐ranked journals. Using neo‐institutional theory, we show that the reasons are dominantly coercive (measuring up to rankings and accreditation agencies) and mimetic (following leaders). Normative (influence of professional bodies) forces appear to counterbalance this by necessitating continuous improvement in research outputs and emphasising location‐specific, impactful research. Institutional responses to these forces manifest in policies and mechanisms to operationalise them, such as resource availability, balancing teaching load with research expectations, promotion and tenure policies amongst others. We examine the paths by which more rigorous and relevant research, responsible to a location can be achieved, based on the insights from a series of talks given by eminent IS scholars. We opine that there is a need to consciously seek out such paths, perhaps by actively seeking collaboration with other disciplines and practitioners; establishing programmes of research; and building contextualised theories. We conclude with a relook at the underlying dynamics of the various institutional responses, recommended paths and some policy implications of our findings.},

By establishing a joint venture among industry incumbents, ADAMOS followed consortium governance that separated platform ownership from platform operation. In so doing, ADAMOS navigated the complexities of market entry and overcame many challenges typical to business‐to‐business (B2B) markets. Drawing from the case, we develop a four‐step framework for effective business‐to‐business platform market entry: (1) Spinning out a neutral legal entity, (2) designing a valuable platform core, (3) seeding the supply side with internal offerings, and (4) opening the platform to broader audiences. Based on this description, we discuss lessons learned and provide actionable recommendations for platform operators considering a consortium‐based approach for their business‐to‐business platform market entry.},

Legal tech innovation, involving the use of digital technologies to provide legal help or services online to ordinary citizens, has significant potential to bridge the access to justice gap at scale. We report on the case of Upsolve, a non‐profit legal tech startup that has revolutionised access to personal bankruptcy filing for low‐income Americans. Upsolve's free digital platform guides users through the step‐by‐step bankruptcy process with extensive and carefully curated information, thus enabling users to navigate bankruptcy filing without needing an attorney. We trace how Upsolve uses human values, namely, safe access , empowerment and psychological well‐being , to guide the design process to ensure that its solution is not only safe for users but also takes special care to empower and support them through the emotionally challenging process of bankruptcy filing. Also, we underscore how Upsolve manages the unauthorised practise of law (UPL) compliance, which prohibits nonlawyers from giving legal advice. Based on our analysis, we derive recommended actions for other organisations to use human values as guidelines in designing and continuously evolving their legal tech innovation to benefit users.},

While significant research from fields such as machine learning and human–computer interaction (HCI) has advanced our understanding of algorithmic fairness, less is known about how managers in organisational contexts perceive and respond to unfair algorithmic recommendations, particularly in terms of individual‐level distributive fairness. This study focuses on job promotions to uncover how algorithmic unfairness impacts managers' perceived fairness and their subsequent acceptance of DA recommendations. Through an experimental study, we find that (1) algorithmic unfairness (against women) in promotion recommendations reduces managers' perceived distributive fairness, influencing their acceptance of these recommendations; (2) managers' trust in DA competency moderates the relationship between perceived fairness and DA recommendation acceptance; and (3) managers' moral identity moderates the impact of algorithmic unfairness on perceived fairness. These insights contribute to the existing literature by elucidating how perceived distributive fairness plays a critical role in managers' acceptance of unfair algorithmic outputs in job promotion contexts, highlighting the importance of trust and moral identity in these processes.},

Debunking or presenting alternative views to conspiracy theories often fails because individuals within these communities can grow more resolute, encouraging and reinforcing their beliefs online. Instead of withering in the face of contradiction, such communities hunker down; escalating their commitment to their conspiratorial beliefs. By interacting over social media platforms, they develop a sense of a shared social identity, which in turn fosters escalating behaviours and can lead to radicalization. For some people, the choice of abandoning or moderating these beliefs is unthinkable because they are too deeply invested to quit. This study advances a second‐order affordance for identity‐driven escalation that explains the process of conspiracy theory radicalization within online communities. We offer a theoretical account of the way social media platforms contribute to escalating commitment to conspiracy radicalization. We show how the sequential and combined actualization of first‐order affordances of the technology enables a second‐order affordance for escalation.},

This study draws upon sensemaking and technological frames to examine the adoption process of an on‐the‐fly developed mobile app in the context of the Gaja cyclone in India. Our findings inform that the adoption of technological innovation in disaster response is linked to its ‘features’ that actors draw upon in their sensemaking process and forming their technological frames. Initial sensemaking and technological framing may involve ‘concrete features’. However, the later sensemaking of evolving contingencies may include discovering various ‘abstract features’ in action. Discoveries of abstract features in action trigger reframing, leading to a congruent technological frame and better exploitation of innovations. Given that natural disasters are occurring more frequently, findings from our study provide critical insights into managing technology innovations in these contexts. The revelation of the role of features in technological (re)framing also enriches the analytical power of the technological frame lens.},

   abstract                      = {This opinion paper presents two proposed token‐based systems to fix the information system academy's review system. At present, the review system consumes more human resources than the information systems academy has by an order of magnitude. The cost of this overflow is borne entirely by information systems researchers. I argue this is because the review system is based on a gift economy that cannot handle the currently sized market. Both proposals involve the creation of tokens and a central governing body. The first proposal involves a market built around a review bank (central governing body) that issues review tokens that function as a proxy currency. Journals function as intermediaries between authors and reviewers. Authors pay journals for reviews, and journals pay experts such as reviewers and editors for their services. Reviewers exchange their review tokens on the open market or trade review tokens for favours with institutions like universities. The second proposal involves a gift economy where reviewers transfer their allegiance from peers to the information systems academy. In this proposal, each individual token is unique, like a trading card and an affiliation board tracks the transfer of tokens, linking former possessors of a token together in a review ring. As tokens are regifted, they accumulate history, and thereby social worth, captured in the form of messages each possessor writes. Former possession of a large number of tokens and of tokens with particular histories confers status benefits. These benefits in turn lock reviewers into the review ring system encouraging them to do further reviews. Economic, social, and other implications of both policies are discussed and questions are posed for the information systems academy to grapple with. Example issues discussed include the effect of the proposals on the political power of reviewers and shifts in political power in the information systems academy.},

In this research, we take a different perspective and focus on the core underlying competencies that high‐reliability organisations (HROs) have shown to be effective in achieving levels of risk tolerance consistent with the goals of a security culture. In doing so we draw on high‐reliability theory to develop a Security Culture Model that explains how a firm's supportive and practical competencies form its organisational security culture. To refine and test the model, we conducted a developmental mixed‐method study using interviews and survey data with professional managers involved in the information security (InfoSec) programs within their respective HROs. Our findings emphasise the importance of an organisation's supportive and practical competencies for developing a culture of security. Our results suggest that organisations' security cultures are a product of their InfoSec practices and that organisational mindfulness, top management involvement and organisational structure are key to the development of those practices.},

Despite increased efforts to provide information systems (IS) security knowledge to employees, data breaches and other security incidents resulting from insider behaviour continue. Recent IS security research, primarily grounded on assumptions of employees' rational assessment of numerous factors, has yielded inconsistent results. Challenging this paradigm, we model secure behaviour on security knowledge mechanisms, which focuses on the multidimensional nature of security knowledge breadth, depth and finesse to represent the full array of managerial levers. We further draw on construal level theory to conceptualise users' perceptual judgements of security messages. Two studies support our model, with the second building on the first. Study 1, an experiment with 312 participants, focused on validating the treatments. Study 2, a survey with 219 participants, validated the entire model. Results showed that our model has significantly more explanatory and predictive power than the orthodox paradigm. Our results have practical implications for optimising the organisation of knowledge mechanisms by emphasising the personal relevance of threats and defining the factors that lead to secure behaviour. We also contribute to the discourse on information security research and provide a template for integrating theories, thus opening new avenues for future research.},

However, prosocial punishments are inadequate for SMIP management because of the personal costs, and few studies propose effective ways to mobilize bystanders. The Chinese government implemented a regulation in 2017 to mobilize bystanders on social media through allocating accountability to act as misinformation supervisors. In China's guanxi culture, prosocial punishments are less observed considering the additional personal costs caused by breaking guanxi. Therefore, assessing the effectiveness of China's cyberspace accountability mobilization can help identify an effective tool for other governments to mitigate SMIP. We used a vignette survey experiment to collect data from WeChat users and applied a random regression model to analyse the data. Accountability mobilization significantly promotes bystanders' prosocial punishment to block the misinformation‐spread‐to‐SMIP path. Guanxi negatively moderates the relationship between accountability mobilization and prosocial punishment to the above path. The government could encourage the public to actively take prosocial punishments by using the new tool of accountability mobilization. Guanxi culture reduces the effectiveness of the tool.},

We report on the results from our longitudinal qualitative case study of a digital platform employed by ministries of health in more than 70 low‐ and middle‐income countries. We trace the formation and subsequent shaping of governance mechanisms employed to enable social options across national borders and domains. We develop a model of platform governance that shows how such mechanisms are shaped over time through resourcing , capacitating and purposing processes. These three processes play distinct yet complementary roles in governing for social options.},

   abstract                      = {ABSTRACT Organisations increasingly deploy conversational AI agents (CAs) in agentic roles where behavioural variations are inevitable. Prior work often conflates two distinct forms of variation: outcome variation (where success fluctuates) and process variation (where the path to completion varies). This study investigates how these two types of variation jointly impact user anthropomorphism and trust, integrating the theory of anthropomorphism with the misconception‐of‐chance bias. Using a CA in an agentic role within a car parking simulation experiment, we manipulate process and outcome variation. Results indicate that outcome variation negatively impacts trust, but process variation shows no such direct effect. Interestingly, while neither variation alone increases anthropomorphism, their interaction does. We theorise that the co‐presence of process and outcome variation prevents falsification of anthropomorphic explanations for the CA's behaviour by creating non‐random‐appearing sequences that violate individuals' randomness expectations due to misconceptions of chance. This allows users to apply human‐like mental models, attributing agency and experience to the CA, making failures interpretable as exploratory behaviour. In contrast, when there is outcome variation without process variation (i.e., the CA fails to achieve the desired outcome but exhibits no process variation), users will tend to infer that the CA is mechanically defective. Our results further demonstrate that the joint effect of process and outcome variation indirectly increases trust through anthropomorphism as a mediator. These findings provide insights into the nuanced ways behavioural variation in CAs influence user trust, contributing to the literature on anthropomorphism, trust in AI, and the misconception of chance.},

The increasing reliance on information and communication technologies (ICTs) heightens the pressure on employees to continuously learn, adapt and manage these tools, which leads to technostress. Despite various strategies to reduce technostress, business and IT leaders lack clarity on effective measures, the optimal implementation and the potential for unintended consequences. This paper presents a case study of a medium‐sized organisation that identified key technostressors and implemented six targeted measures. As a result, employee sick days dropped by 22% and project outcomes increased. Based on these insights, we propose a seven‐step framework that supports business and IT leaders in reducing technostress across departments, thereby enhancing individual effectiveness and employee health, as well as driving overall organisational performance.},

However, how different ITs can be leveraged collectively to achieve corporate entrepreneurship remains largely underexplored. Drawing upon the knowledge‐based view, we develop an integrative theoretical model to delineate how three types of commonly deployed IT (i.e. organisational enterprise systems use, organisational social media use and top management team social media use) can be used collectively in the knowledge acquisition and utilisation processes to achieve corporate entrepreneurship. Specifically, we posit that organisational IT uses (i.e. organisational enterprise systems use and organisational social media use) enhance openness to external knowledge in the knowledge acquisition process, which in turn serves as the mediation mechanism to channel organisational IT uses into corporate entrepreneurship. Moreover, top management team IT use (i.e. top management team social media use) shapes the effect of openness to external knowledge on corporate entrepreneurship in the knowledge utilisation process. The empirical analysis using multi‐respondent survey data from 1252 managers in 313 firms provides strong support for the proposed model. This study contributes to the information systems research on how IT influences corporate entrepreneurship by distinguishing the roles of organisational enterprise systems use, organisational social media use and top management team social media use in enhancing corporate entrepreneurship through firms' openness to external knowledge.},

Although several agile scaling frameworks offer portfolio practice recommendations, their longer‐term effectiveness is unclear, given the lack of rigorous theoretical foundations. Consequently, it is uncertain how these practices sustain agility and optimise value realisation from their Information Systems investments. This study adopts a systems‐theoretic approach to identify causal mechanisms that sustain agility within enterprise IS portfolios. Using a critical realist perspective, we analyse existing IS portfolio practices from three distinct enterprises to evolve an explanatory framework comprising two generative mechanisms and a structural arrangement of portfolio practices that help achieve sustained portfolio agility by sensing, assessing, learning from, and responding to changes in its internal and external environments while ensuring a sustained flow of business value. In addition to being a comprehensive tool for practitioners designing and diagnosing agile IS portfolio capabilities, our results extend existing theoretical approaches to understanding agility at the portfolio level and provide opportunities to refine existing models to address the dynamic complexities of IS portfolio agility.},

By conducting multiple case studies of three distinct ecosystems that have successfully embraced platformization, we arrive at three separate process patterns of preparation for ecosystem platformization that elucidate the dimensions of organisational readiness required of the initiating firm and its partners.

Burnout among CISOs is a growing concern, with implications for both individual well‐being and organisational resilience. To advance the understanding of CISO burnout, we conducted interviews with 37 CISOs across various industries. Our analysis identified six core stressor categories: organisational culture, resource limitations, job responsibilities, communication and relationship management, emerging threats and external pressures. These stressors interact in interdependent and dynamic ways. We present a typology of these interactions: contingent, complementary and substitutive that collectively shape burnout trajectories. Thus, we reconceptualise CISO burnout as an emergent outcome of interdependent stressor interactions. Our model highlights how organisational security culture enables other stressors, while external disruptions and CISO maturity further influence stress dynamics. We also introduce the concept of expectation asymmetry to capture the communicative burdens CISOs face and identify a paradox of CISO maturity, wherein leadership progression redistributes rather than reduces stress. Together, these insights provide a multidimensional perspective on stressors' interactions leading to burnout and offer actionable guidance for building more resilient cybersecurity leadership through coordinated, organisation‐wide efforts.},

   abstract                      = {Digital platform ecosystems increasingly dominate the enterprise software domain, and the persistence of platforms depends on the sustained engagement of complementors. However, there is a limited understanding of its antecedents, complementors' evaluation of antecedents and the manifestations and dynamic changes of complementors' engagement. Therefore, we investigate complementors' engagement within platform ecosystems over time. We draw on actor and stakeholder engagement from service research to conceptualise complementor engagement (CE) and create an integrated empirical understanding of CE and its dynamics in digital platform ecosystems. Our embedded case study builds on 30 interviews with complementors in Anubis and Osiris enterprise software platform ecosystems. Inductive data analysis reveals five CE antecedents: platform resources and rules, platform value proposition, platform agents, customer needs and other complementors' value propositions. The antecedents are associated with three CE behaviours: generating, networking and synchronising. Further analysis of CE over time resulted in 26 different sequences representing stable and changing engagement trajectories, the latter comprising selective, growing and abating engagement as subcategories. We show how complementors' evaluations of antecedents lead to behaviour changes, providing a novel perspective on the dynamics underlying CE. Finally, we link complementors' evaluation outcomes to their (dis)satisfaction, contributing to the discussion on what drives and impedes CE. The findings implicate the debate on dynamic platform governance and inform platform owners about using cooperative and competitive approaches in the short and long term.},

Despite the importance of museums, the interaction between these conventional institutions and advanced technologies remains relatively underexplored in information systems (IS) research. Adopting affordance‐actualisation (A–A) theory as the theoretical lens, we conducted an in‐depth case study of the Palace Museum in Beijing, China, to investigate its implementation of evolving IS for heritage preservation. We identify three key affordances of these systems and develop a conceptual model illustrating the process of actualising these affordances. Our model extends A–A theory by adding an adaptation phase, wherein the museum responds to the outcomes of the actualisation process by amplifying the achieved outcomes and altering the unintended ones. Additionally, we uncover a hierarchical structure among these affordances, revealing a progressive pattern of actualisation specific to heritage preservation in museums. This research contributes to the literature on A–A theory, heritage preservation in museums, and IS implementation. Furthermore, it provides guidance for practitioners, particularly those in museum contexts, in effectively implementing IS for heritage preservation.},

This empirical study taps into the understudied civic crowdfunding platforms (CCP) developed to facilitate such actions, proposing, supporting and funding public‐interest projects through crowdsourcing and microfinancing. Previous studies have shown that individuals' characteristics affect their level of civic engagement with social issues. Considering the diversity of contributor motivations, we aim to shed light on the dynamics of emergent subpopulations of citizens who participate in CCPs. To this end, we use a sequential mixed‐methods approach to integrate our fuzzy set Qualitative Comparative Analysis (fsQCA) findings with the results of an in‐depth qualitative study, to gain rich and robust inferences and meta‐inferences. In Study 1 ( n = 316), we used fsQCA to explore five distinctive configural profiles that display the heterogeneity of civic backers' motivations, including civic champions , prosocial advocates , normative supporters , reward seekers and regret‐averse contributors . In Study 2, we corroborated and complemented our fsQCA inferences through an extreme‐case study and identified four boundary conditions. Taken together, our inferences and meta‐inferences address the heterogeneity of motivations for participating in CCPs, by understanding and theorising about diverse profiles of citizen backers. Finally, we offer practical implications for successful civic crowdfunding initiatives.},

Moreover, regulatory efforts to shape industry‐level digital transformation often produce unwanted outcomes. Existing theories are insufficient for examining this complex relationship between regulation and digital transformation. Our case study of the Finnish taxi industry illustrates these complexities. The industry underwent a legal reform intended to legalise Uber‐type solutions while restricting certain other solutions. By drawing on the notion of regulatory ambiguity and mechanism‐based explanation, we show how ambiguity arises from the imprecise regulation in connection with conflicting regulation and technological uncertainties. We model the regulatory ambiguity mechanism consisting of the interconnected elements that, by affecting each other and working together, drive unintended changes in the technology landscape. We theorise regulatory ambiguity as a condition that emerges when regulations are imprecise, inconsistent, or evolving. This ambiguity shapes the technology landscape and related industry‐specific practices, impacting digital transformation. Our research contributes to the literature on digital transformation and on the regulation of technology. We identify and analyse the regulatory ambiguity mechanism, providing information systems (IS) researchers with a novel framework to examine the role of regulation in digital transformation. We also conceptualise regulatory impact as a lens for future IS research.},

However, information overload, falsehoods and unrelated topics hinder information flow in virtual communities, putting disaster victims at risk. Given many disasters are generally of a short duration, we explore how virtual communities can quickly reconfigure themselves to respond effectively to a disaster. Drawing on risk society theory, our findings suggest reconfiguration is done via a series of cycles initially involving community members and subsequently featuring both community members and moderators working together to mitigate risks. We contribute to virtual community discourse on disaster response by showing how a virtual community can configure IT features to bring about change. Practically, we find transforming a virtual community from a normal to a disaster response mode requires (1) creating a controlled information hub, (2) promoting identity revelation and (3) allowing for temporary emergent hyperlocal leadership. While earlier IS research suggests that anonymity, openness and geographical dispersion are important for information dissemination in virtual communities, we suggest these practices may need to be changed during a disaster.},

In this study, we focus on content production and examine how information technology (IT) can reduce the digital production divide for digitally disadvantaged groups. Despite the literature suggesting that content production skills are more advanced than content consumption, short‐video platforms have gained popularity worldwide, offering previously underrepresented communities in digital production an unprecedented medium for self‐expression. Using an interpretive case study approach and adaptive structuration theory (AST) as a conceptual framework, we analyse data from platform managers and users of a short‐video platform in India. We explore the change in users' practices toward content creation and highlight the role played by technology in more inclusive content production. We find that content consumption and production are interdependent and that various aspects of the IT artefact, such as technical objects, symbolic expressions, functional affordances and spirit, reduce different levels of the digital production divide. We contribute to the research on digital production divide by identifying three mechanisms that illustrate how the appropriation and sense‐making of the IT artefacts reduce the skill gap and enable better outcomes for users by minimising the influence of their offline resources.},

   abstract                      = {ABSTRACT Membership in regulatory sandboxes seems to help financial technology ventures (FinTechs) signal their qualities to investors. However, FinTechs have a dual identity, meaning they are both banking firms and entrepreneurial, growth‐oriented ventures, and thus likely send various and potentially conflicting signals. Knowledge of how additional signals might change the effectiveness of sandbox membership remains limited. Drawing on signalling theory, we analyse how two venture‐related signals — entrepreneurial orientation (EO) and venture size — influence the effect of sandbox membership on funding. We examine our model using a panel dataset covering the period from 2015 until 2020, comprising 94 FinTechs from the regulatory sandbox in the United Kingdom and a random control group of 90 comparable FinTechs without sandbox membership. We find signalling sandbox membership to improve FinTechs' funding, while signalling high EO and growth orientation diminishes this effect. Our insights advance research on FinTechs' signalling strategy, suggesting that they should emphasise their banking side over their entrepreneurial, growth‐oriented side when communicating with potential investors.},

Furthermore, we identified resources that may alleviate such fatigue. The research model was tested with data collected from 386 employees of organisations with ISPs. The findings indicate that job and personal resources can reduce the occurrence of security fatigue and engagement in opportunistic security behaviours by enhancing engagement. In addition, the effect of security fatigue on opportunistic security behaviours can be suppressed through the implementation of behavioural evaluations.

Rather than focusing on individual organisations, this study examines GenAI integration within enterprise platforms, which are extensively adopted by many organisations and thus amplify both the benefits and risks of GenAI. We offer targeted recommendations for enterprise platform owners and their complementors, addressing challenges they face when integrating GenAI into these platforms. Drawing on a case study of Salesforce's experience, we recommend actions in three foundational areas – platform capability, architecture and governance – ensuring that our guidance is broadly applicable across enterprise platforms. In platform capability, we advise developing a unified GenAI stack built on existing platform services, offering generic and industry‐specific GenAI use cases to accelerate customer adoption and providing tools for customisation and creation of new use cases to enhance GenAI's transformational impact. For platform architecture, we recommend adding new layers for accommodating diverse GenAI foundation models and creating a trusted environment for secure data access, privacy and content monitoring. We also recommend implementing a prompt architecture to improve content relevance and accuracy. In platform governance, we recommend establishing new mechanisms to mitigate GenAI risks. Partnerships with GenAI providers and proactive investments in GenAI are essential to retain critical GenAI technologies. Personalised consultancy and training along with joint design and implementation with platform customers are also recommended. These combined actions, pursued in parallel across capability, architecture and governance, form a sustainable roadmap for GenAI integration in enterprise platforms.},

Interorganizational data exchange comes with new challenges in terms of data governance. Inspired by organisational information processing theory, this paper follows an action design research (ADR) approach to create a robust data governance framework. Four design principles, namely flexible digital platform, corporate data broker, mutual trust, and multi‐level monetisation, are introduced. Based on these principles, it is possible to develop a lean and robust business process for interorganizational data exchange. The evaluation of this process is based on exemplary projects coming from the Catena‐X network. The cross‐functional observations from these projects provide practical insights that guide practitioners and managers within networked organisations in identifying best practice principles and processes for effective interorganizational data governance. Thereby, this framework enables organisations to promote a standardised approach to data exchange that can be replicated across different organisational networks.},

   abstract                      = {ABSTRACT Social virtual world (SVW) platforms face a critical challenge to retain a sound base of active users, which is key to their success and requires a deep understanding of how much (lean usage) and how exactly (rich usage) users' usage behaviours occur in these platforms. While both lean and rich usage are pivotal considerations in the SVW context, prior research has primarily assumed an omnibus conceptualisation of SVW usage that does not differentiate subtypes of usage. This results in limited knowledge about the sophisticated relationships and differences between lean and rich usage, making it difficult to reconcile inconclusive findings regarding how SVW usage is affected by its antecedents (e.g., commitment). In this paper, we draw upon the tripartite view of system usage to substantiate lean and rich usage constructs in the SVW context. Then, based upon the sociotechnical perspective (particularly the concepts of multifinality and equifinality) and the literature on SVW usage, we develop a research model to investigate the curvilinear relationships between lean usage (manifested in the extent and breadth of usage) and rich usage (represented by task variety and cognitive absorption), and the differential effects of two commitment components (affective and calculative commitment) on rich versus lean usage in the SVW context. Using two‐wave field survey data from 312 users of Second Life (a pioneering SVW platform), we find sophisticated (linear/quadratic) relationships between lean and rich usage constructs: the extent of usage triggers the breadth of usage and task variety, and has a convex (U‐shaped) relationship with cognitive absorption; the breadth of usage is positively related to cognitive absorption and has a concave (inverted J‐shaped) relationship with task variety. Furthermore, we confirm that affective commitment positively affects both lean and rich usage, whereas calculative commitment directly triggers only lean usage (the breadth of usage) but not rich usage. These findings have important theoretical implications for the research on SVW usage and commitment and provide useful insights for SVW practitioners to promote users' prolonged and active usage behaviours.},

   abstract                      = {Although health information systems (HIS) play an important role in elevating health standards, a comprehensive understanding of how to effectively implement HIS in rural areas is lacking. This issue becomes more significant when considering that globally a majority of the approximately 1.5 million deaths of children under the age of five in 2019 that were attributable to vaccine‐preventable diseases occurred in rural areas. Accordingly, we ask two questions. How does rurality influence the implementation of information and communication technology for development (ICT4D) projects? How do organisations navigate challenges associated with rurality during the implementation of these projects? Our findings, derived from an in‐depth case study of a social enterprise in rural India, reveal two paradoxes that pose challenges to the effective implementation of HIS in rural settings: the localisation paradox and the cultural embedding paradox. We found that contextually balanced engagement was comprised of four organisational responses—prioritising; localising; cultural adjustment; and engaging stakeholders—that help navigate the challenges posed by the localisation and cultural embedding paradoxes. Synthesising these findings, we develop a process model that shows how the implementation of HIS in rural areas is shaped by the descriptive and sociocultural characteristics of rurality. Further, organisations require a dynamic approach, engaging in multiple responses over time to navigate the paradoxes inherent in HIS implementation. We suggest that organisational responses to paradoxical tensions stemming from the descriptive and sociocultural characteristics of rurality lead to the development of HIS e nabled for rurality. Our findings contribute the understanding of ICT4D projects implementation.},

To stay relevant, however, organisations struggle to comprehensively outline the digital capabilities they have or need in relation to the digital transformation objectives they aim for. This struggle stems from the paucity of knowledge and practical guidance on how to assess the digital capabilities of organisations relative to their desired digital transformation goals. This paper presents a framework (MIND Framework) for assessing digital capabilities in four critical areas – Management (M), Infrastructure (I), Networking/Sourcing (N), and Development (D) – abstracted from prior literature. The framework assesses digital capability status in each area in relation to the organisation's stated digital transformation goals. MIND, which is an outcome of a multi‐year design science research project, helps organisations assess their current capability status and create a pathway for navigating from their current status to the desired transformation state. In this article, we describe an in‐depth application of the MIND framework in assessing the digital capabilities of an incumbent company in the digital transformation process. Based on this, we illustrate how the framework can provide valuable insights and attitudinal shifts in an organisation's digital transformation efforts. We further abstract from the case to demonstrate how the assessment of an organisation's digital capabilities can provide valuable insights and critical input for any organisation embarking on a digital transformation journey. We conclude with a detailed guideline on how organisations can apply the MIND framework in their transformation journey.},

While an admirable goal, it is nevertheless a challenging prospect, as key questions remain around how best to facilitate a relationship between IS academic and practitioner communities. To explore this issue, we analyse multi‐case study data from interviews with 24 IS practitioner doctorates, industry contact points, and senior IS academics who sought to create a joint field between academia and practice during their research. Our findings reveal several boundary spanning activities needed to traverse field boundaries and maintain the joint field's existence across the stages of proof‐of‐concept, proof‐of‐value, and proof‐of‐use. Building on insights from the work of Pierre Bourdieu, we further discuss how IS practitioner doctorates operationalised capital , doxa , and habitus to achieve varying degrees of practical impact in their work. Action‐oriented recommendations are presented to support practical impact going forward including creolised messages and the mobilisation of capital to change inter‐field relationships. By adapting Bourdieu's Theory of Practice to the engaged scholarship discourse in IS, we contribute new insights into how the academia‐practice gap might be addressed.},

   abstract                      = {The online phenomenon of social commerce (i.e., s‐commerce ) platforms has emerged as a combination of online social networking and e‐commerce. On s‐commerce platforms, consumers can observe others' behavioural decisions and can distinguish those made by their friends from those made by their followees (i.e., the people a focal consumer follows but who do not follow that consumer back). Given this distinction, our study examines how consumers' behavioural decisions—regarding, for example, purchases, ratings, or “likes”—are made on s‐commerce platforms, with a focus on how they are influenced by prior decisions of friends and followees. Combining panel data from a large s‐commerce platform and two controlled experiments, we identify a strong normative social influence pattern in which consumers tend to follow others' prior decisions to gain social approval. Because the occurrence of normative social influence depends on both consumer behaviours with high public visibility and strong consumer needs to establish social ties, the unique information concerning behaviour visibility and consumers' social needs in the panel data allows us to identify normative social influence and to distinguish it from informational confounding mechanisms. Our panel data results show that on a friend network , where consumers' behavioural decisions are visible, females exhibit a greater tendency to follow others' prior decisions than males. We attribute this result to the stronger social needs of females. However, on a followee network , where behavioural decisions are invisible, these differences become less evident. Moreover, the two experiments demonstrate that making decision contexts private or activating social needs via a priming procedure can thwart (or even turn off) normative social influence. Our findings challenge prior research that identifies informational social influence as the predominant driver of conformity behaviours and thus have important implications for practice related to normative social influence, such as the development of techniques for satisfying consumers' different social needs depending on their gender or any other situational factors on s‐commerce platforms.},

There exist, however, limited methodological insights into existing reflexive approaches and a limited understanding of how self‐transformation and change can take place through more critically reflexive ICT4D research practice. To address these issues, this paper proposes a reflexive methodology for ICT4D research, labelled “the 4Rs”, which comprises four interrelated reflective and potentially self‐transforming processes of Retrospection, Representation, Review and Reinterpretation. We present the explanations and justifications of the methodology in detail with illustrative examples. We also employ a metacognitive process to understand how self‐transformation can be realised through the use of this methodology and demonstrate the applicability of the 4Rs for other ICT4D researchers. Our main contribution lies in illustrating how this collective and critical approach can be used to deepen the self‐reflexivity of traditional individual confessional accounts. We also demonstrate how the approach can lead to new collective knowledge and contribute to achieving more critical agency.},

However, full delegation to an AI application is often not possible or desirable due to technical limitations, ethical concerns or legal issues. Augmented intelligence systems, where humans and AI work together jointly, have been proposed to improve decision making in complex, uncertain and failure‐intolerant environments. Yet, this raises questions about how compatible human and AI knowledge are, and whether translating between the two increases decision making intelligence, or whether it effectively limits AI applications' capacity for computational agency and human agents' capacity to consider uniquely human knowledge. We explore this notion by looking at augmented intelligence in terms of systemic intelligence and mutual learning. Building on an emergence perspective, we perform a case study of an augmented intelligence system for image‐based diagnostics in the radiology branch of a medical care centre. Our findings indicate a strong distinction between specialists' and non‐specialists' intelligence augmentation with AI. This distinction fuels generative cycles which produce iteratively more sophisticated algorithms, human representations and practical routines. Drawing on this analysis, we propose three stages by which new forms of intelligence emerge from the addition of AI recommendation tools, specifically, intelligence by propagation, intelligence by specialisation and intelligence by articulation.},

Therefore, to understand how working conditions on digital labor platforms influence the dynamic career paths of freelancers, we conduct an exploratory analysis using 35 interviews with freelancers and clients on digital labor platforms. We thus contribute to the body of knowledge on alternative forms of work on digital labor platforms by developing a long‐term freelancing career model and outlining the dynamics of advancement, decline, and exit within platform careers.

To motivate residents to adopt more sustainable behaviours, user interfaces on smartphones and laptops are increasingly using consumption data from households' smart meters to enable effective goal‐setting. In contrast to previous research largely focusing on goal‐setting in isolation, this study examines the role of specific social comparison‐related design features that future research and practitioners can consider along with goal‐setting to stimulate sustainable behaviours. Specifically, we look into the influence of residents' perception of their relative performance (i.e., whether their behaviour was better or worse than a reference group) on their ambition to act (i.e., targeted improvement goal) and their actual energy consumption behaviour. Moreover, we investigate the influence of a goal's evaluative standard (i.e., whether the goal refers to one's own or other's performance) on the relationship between relative performance, ambition to act, and energy consumption behaviour. Drawing on social comparison theory, we conducted a framed field experiment with 152 households. We find that a goal's evaluative standard influences residents' awareness of their relative performance, affecting their ambition to act and, ultimately, their energy consumption behaviour. More specifically, we find that whereas other‐ (vs. self‐) referencing goals encourage residents from worse‐than‐average performing households more strongly to improve their energy consumption behaviour, they discourage better‐than‐average ones. Overall, our study provides novel insights into the interplay between relative performance and evaluative standards as a means of fostering social comparison in smart meter‐facilitated goal‐setting, highlighting their crucial role in effectively supporting sustainable behaviours.},

Although this important sociotechnical phenomenon has garnered increasing attention, IS studies on this topic are scarce. Drawing on uncertainty reduction theory, we explored mechanisms for reducing BoP drivers' uncertainty and building their trust to enable them to engage in ridesharing. We identified three means of uncertainty reduction at three levels: trust in passengers, trust in ridesharing platforms, and the effectiveness of ridesharing institutional mechanisms. Using a sequential, triangulated mixed‐methods approach, we conducted 30 semi‐structured interviews to explore trust building with drivers and used data provided by 303 ridesharing drivers to quantitatively test the proposed research model. We found that perceived empathy and information congruity increased BoP drivers' trust in passengers, whereas effective escrow services, perceived justice, matching accuracy, and a high level of privacy control increased BoP drivers' perceived trust in ridesharing platforms, motivating them to engage more frequently with ridesharing platforms. Furthermore, the results indicated that increasing trust in both passengers and ridesharing platforms and improving the effectiveness of ridesharing institutional mechanisms can enhance BoP drivers' engagement in ridesharing. We conducted 30 follow‐up interviews with BoP drivers to corroborate the quantitative results and draw robust inferences.},

Many popular mobile massively multiplayer online games (MMOGs) adopt social network embeddedness (SNE) functions to optimise players' social play experience. SNE changes the traditional pattern of MMOG social play by porting acquaintance relationships (e.g., Facebook friends) from social networking sites to the virtual game world. However, little understanding exists on how SNE impacts mobile MMOG players' game participation results such as play performance and play frequency. Drawing on the affordance framework and social capital literature, this research proposes a theoretical model that integrates the factors of SNE technology affordance (identity transparency and information transparency), players' social experience (social interaction, social support, shared vision, and social pressure), plus affordance effects (play performance and play frequency). The model was validated through a longitudinal field study, in which both subjective and objective data were collected from Game for Peace players. Our findings indicate that identity transparency and information transparency positively correlate with social interaction, social support, shared vision, and social pressure, which, taken together, significantly affect play frequency. The results also show that social interaction and shared vision positively impact players' play performance. The study enhances the theoretical understanding of social relationships in players' game participation results from the SNE aspect. Finally, we lend insights on how game operators can improve player game experience and stickiness.},

We also articulate the interaction mechanism of these strong and weak signals by demonstrating their complementary or substitutive effects in alleviating information asymmetry on startup quality, which can help digital startups secure venture capital financing. Drawing on signalling theory and institutional legitimacy theory, we introduce application (app) downloads as a novel strong signal that can reduce market legitimacy concerns, and previous‐round venture capitalist reputation as a traditional strong signal that mitigates regulatory legitimacy concerns. We treat founders' startup and IT experience as weak signals, as they provide rhetorical and indirect information indicating a startup's potential to establish regulatory and market legitimacy. The study empirically investigates our hypotheses using data of 163 digital startups in various industries of China. Results confirm the positive relationships between strong signals and venture capital funding secured by a digital startup. Furthermore, signals of similar strength are found to complement each other's effects in certain situations, while strong signals can reduce the effects of weak signals on a digital startup's financing performance under specific conditions that create these mixed effects. Implications for digital startup research and practice as well as limitations and suggestions for future research are discussed.},

   abstract                      = {ABSTRACT Open source software (OSS) is becoming increasingly crucial for companies as they use OSS components in a wide range of products, including cars, smart‐home equipment, and many more, as well as in their internal processes. However, OSS comes with regulations and licensing conditions with which companies need to comply. This complicates the company's software acquisition and hinders the broader diffusion of OSS. In this paper, we study a novel approach that could reduce or overcome barriers to software acquisition in business‐to‐business transactions: the certification of software suppliers for OSS compliance based on the ISO 5230 regulatory standard. This standard specifies OSS compliance and, in addition to third‐party certification involving an auditor, allows suppliers to self‐certify. Building on institution‐based trust and signalling theory, we hypothesise that a supplier's OSS compliance certification is a critical selection criterion for companies acquiring software. Specifically, we expect that self‐certification constitutes a valuable signal influencing the selection decision, although we expect it to be weaker than third‐party certification. We further hypothesise that the acquirer's awareness of the standard strengthens the effect of self‐certification and that their perceived OSS procurement risk strengthens the impact of third‐party certification. Using a discrete choice‐based conjoint experiment, we find evidence supporting our hypotheses and demonstrate that self‐certification can be a viable substitute for third‐party certification. Our study contributes to the understanding of the diffusion and adoption of OSS, extends signalling theory by comparing self‐certification with third‐party certification, and extends the information systems literature on institution‐based trust.},

Our exploratory case study of an EHR system implemented in Italy reveals four types of actions (flexing, bypassing, avoiding, and reorganising) through which different types of unintended consequences occur with the (non‐)actualisation of affordances. We explain and theorise how interactions among technology features and psychosocial and organisational constraints/enablers contribute to users' perception of affordances and technological constraints. This, in turn, influences different types of user actions, leading to unintended consequences. Our findings and insights contribute to the literature on unintended consequences and help organisations better manage implementing new systems.},

Established design research methodologies need complementary tools to support design researchers in configuring their design activities and representing them faithfully, dimensions that contribute to a shared understanding. This article presents Baustein as an instance of such design tools. Baustein is tailorable to the contextual requirements of each design research project, comprising an ensemble of card‐deck, ready‐made configurations, and a manual. To ensure theoretical and practical relevance, the design of Baustein is based on primary empirical data (workshop and interviews with 16 IS design researchers) and a literature analysis of 99 published IS design research projects. We demonstrate its proof‐of‐value through three main evaluation episodes, altogether involving over 110 IS design researchers. With Baustein, design research teams can balance the trade‐off between creative messiness and standardised configurations of design activities.},

A conceptual frontier suggests that we begin to conceptualise the worlds in which future organisations and people observe digital technologies and their enactments as an unexceptional and quite mundane aspect of their daily lives. We initiate conceptualising being digital as an outcome of the transformations our current research studies. A second analytic frontier embraces world‐making in current theorizations and the development of future‐leaning conceptualization of alternative worlds. Speculative foresight is an approach for staging new concepts and relationships, critiquing current research practice and theory boundaries, and creating novel and generative theorizations. An example speculative foresight scenario illustrates onto‐epistemic assumptions and ambiguities in current theories of digital transformation regarding how future ethics will be conceived. The implications and limitations of this approach are discussed in the context of the need for IS research to develop orientations that can contribute to understanding digital transformation processes and both positive and negative transformation outcomes that will constitute yet unrealized futures.},

In this paper, we investigate this topic through a detailed analysis of Hedera's first 10 years—from the initial concept to a maturing coalition‐based governance structure—illustrating how a thoughtful coalition formation can guide effective governance development over time. We also critically examine Hedera's limitations to derive further practical insights. Building on this empirical foundation, we contribute to the governance discourse by defining blockchain coalition formation as a dynamic, multi‐phase strategic process for aligning interests, distributing authority, and achieving operational coherence within blockchain networks. We introduce the Virtuous Cycle for Sustainable Blockchain Coalitions to illustrate how effective coalition‐based governance reinforces stakeholder trust, drives platform adoption, and sustains long‐term collaboration.

Recent research has highlighted the influence of digital ecosystems on digital transformation, but we lack knowledge about how this relationship unfolds across the organisational and the ecosystem levels. Following a phenomenon‐based theorising approach and applying a digital resource‐based view, we present the OCO (orientation, cooperation, orchestration) theory of digital transformation. The OCO theory explains the relationship between an organisation's digital transformation and its integration into a digital ecosystem. We uncover and explain three interdependent mechanisms, that is, orientation, cooperation, and orchestration, that are set in motion by cross‐level interactions between the organisational and the ecosystem levels and that centre around digital resources. Our work advances the frontier of multi‐level digital transformation research explaining the influence of a digital ecosystem on digital transformation. We conclude through six propositions that the deeper its digital ecosystem integration, the more likely an organisation's digital transformation is effective. Therewith, we aim at mobilising future digital transformation research to bridge the organisational and the ecosystem levels and provide four future research themes. Our work also encourages practitioners to acknowledge and manage the influence of digital ecosystems on digital transformation.},

   abstract                      = {The utilisation of information and communication technology (ICT) has a profound impact on e‐governance across countries, albeit, with limited attention to rural areas. The existing literature on this topic either examines the positive effects of ICT use on e‐governance at the individual level or from the urban–rural dichotomy perspective. Meanwhile, the majority of studies are conducted within an urban context, but they scarcely focus on identifying the challenges in developing rural e‐governance. As such, we contend that an ecology perspective is necessary to identify the specific distinctions of ICT use on e‐governance in various rural ecosystems. To this end, we employ various empirical specifications, namely a fixed‐effects model and an instrumental variable approach, to provide evidence of distinct influences of ICT use on e‐governance. As follows, we adopt a qualitative research approach to gather evidence on the differentiations of ICT use on rural e‐governance within diverse ecosystems. Subsequently, we have identified five crucial obstacles encountered by rural ecosystems in Western China while attempting to develop e‐governance. Furthermore, we delineate an all‐encompassing internal‐external strategy to overcome these challenges.},

Traditional approaches to creating such platforms are hindered by both limited expertise and significant resource investments, exposing substantial development risks. Here we use Design Fictions to construct a low‐cost, low‐effort Minimum Viable Product for archives, record labels, publishers, and private collections. In identifying our key learnings, our research advances a coherent four‐stage process model comprising of conceptualisation, realisation, materialisation, and evaluation. The model delineates the critical activities required at each stage, offering practitioners a structured yet flexible framework that bridges the gap between initial concept development and full‐scale system implementation. By prioritising Design Fictions as a means of early‐stage prototyping, we encourage a more agile and responsive exploration of ‘provocations of the future’, thus minimising risks while refining the understanding of business and user needs alongside technological possibilities and constraints. In doing so, we expedite the identification of vital design insights and provide practical guidance for those striving to harness the potential of emerging Metaverse technologies within a sustainable and economically viable framework.},

The management of AI projects at Consult is a multi‐method approach that draws on elements from traditional project management, agile practices, and AI workflow practices. While the combination of these elements enables Consult to be effective in delivering AI projects to their customers, our analysis reveals that managing AI projects in this way draw upon three core logics , that is, commonly shared norms, values, and prescribed behaviours which influence actors' understanding of how work should be done. We identify that the simultaneous presence of these three logics—a traditional project management logic, an agile logic, and an AI workflow logic—gives rise to conflicts and issues in managing AI projects at Consult, and successfully managing these AI projects involves resolving conflicts that arise between them. From our case findings, we derive four strategies to help organisations better manage their AI projects.},

Despite criticisms regarding overfitting, misspecification and sample size limitations, SEM remains invaluable for rigorous theoretical model testing when applied correctly. This Methods Article aims to streamline the extensive SEM criteria into essential considerations segmented across three critical stages: data preparation, measurement validation and structural modelling. This provides scholars with a comprehensive guide tailored to meet the stringent requirements of top‐tier scientific journals. We outline data design considerations, progress through key SEM processes, and conclude with guidelines for testing specific hypotheses. We also illuminate relevant validation criteria for each stage, forming a foundational framework for rigorous SEM analysis. Neglecting any of these criteria can trigger irreversible analytical errors. We provide examples of how missing some criteria can drastically change results. We also demonstrate an ongoing issue with inadequate reporting of these criteria in IS journals, exacerbating these issues. Currently, SEM instruction is dispersed across numerous books and articles across different fields and decades, often with complex explanations. Our principal contribution is consolidating a comprehensive set of validation criteria into an articulated guide for scholars not yet proficient in SEM. However, this is not a step‐by‐step walkthrough for advanced SEM users. We advocate for a structured, transparent reporting system for these criteria, shifting the responsibility for methodological clarity onto the author and facilitating a more precise understanding for readers. Our recommendations aim to enhance the integrity of SEM applications in research by elevating reporting standards.},

While innovation is often viewed as a product of individual creativity, it more commonly unfolds through a collaborative process where creativity intertwines with knowledge. However, the extent and effectiveness of GenAI in supporting this process remain open questions. Our study investigates this issue using a collaborative practice research approach focused on three GenAI‐enabled innovation projects conducted within different organisations. We explored how, why, and when GenAI could effectively be integrated into design sprints—a highly structured, collaborative process enabling human‐centred innovation. Our research identified challenges and opportunities in synchronising AI capabilities with human intelligence and creativity. To translate these insights into practical strategies, we propose four recommendations for organisations eager to leverage GenAI to both streamline and bring more value to their innovation processes: (1) establish a collaborative intelligence value loop with GenAI; (2) build trust in GenAI; (3) develop robust data collection and curation workflows; and (4) embrace a craftsman's discipline.},

Despite growing scholarly interest in the configurational approach, little is known about how moderation functions in conjunctural causation. Although there is a growing urgency for elucidating the boundary conditions of conjunctural causation to bolster the precision of theoretical explanations, a systematic approach to theorising, identifying, and interpreting moderation in configurational theories is missing. To bridge this knowledge gap, we first establish the theoretical grounding for moderation in the configurational approach. We then articulate the theoretical mechanism underlying how the interdependence of causal factors in a causal recipe is altered by the presence of a moderator. We also offer guidance on how to validate and interpret moderation in the configurational approach based on Qualitative Comparative Analysis (QCA). We conduct an illustrative study in the context of technostress to showcase the utility of our proposed guidelines and their value in aiding theory development. Our study hence contributes to extant literature by attesting to the significance of moderation in the configurational approach and offering recommendations for theorising such moderations. Insights from this study can be harnessed to guide future theory development by identifying and validating moderated configurational relationships, which in turn can further enhance our understanding of nuances in multifaceted digital phenomena.},

This entails analysing the lines of action that intertwine to form storylines of digital transformation. Drawing on a multilevel longitudinal qualitative study, the research offers three valuable contributions: First, the paper advances the discourse on digital transformation by introducing the heretofore unrecognised phenomenon of transitional moments . Second, by introducing a novel taxonomy for lines of action, the paper demonstrates the evolving nature of the digital transformation process, surpassing conventional rational‐system model interpretations. These two contributions broaden the process frontier of digital transformation by underscoring the dynamic and continuous nature of digital transformation, emphasising its non‐linear progression, and rejecting the notion of an idealised direct path to a predefined goal. These two additions to the digital transformation discourse lay the foundations for our third contribution, which is a set of proposed research approaches for future investigations into digital transformation, regardless of research focus, phenomena, or domain.},

Although AI provides more convenience to consumers and more efficient and profitable marketing for organisations, the act of aggregating data into behavioural profiles for use in machine learning algorithms introduces significant privacy implications for users, including unforeseeable personal disclosure, outcomes biased against marginalised population groups and organisations' inability to fully remove data from AI systems on consumer request. Although these implementations of AI are rapidly altering the way consumers perceive information privacy, researchers have thus far lacked an accurate method for measuring consumers' privacy concerns related to AI. In this study, we aim to (1) validate a scale for measuring privacy concerns related to AI misuse (PC‐AIM) and (2) examine the effects that PC‐AIM has on nomologically related constructs under the APCO framework. We provide evidence demonstrating the validity of our newly developed scale. We also find that PC‐AIM significantly increases risk beliefs and personal privacy advocacy behaviour, while decreasing trusting beliefs. Trusting beliefs and risk beliefs do not significantly affect behaviour, which differs from prior privacy findings. We further discuss the implications of our work on both research and practice.},

The findings reveal significant cultural tensions, including those related to inclusive access, diminished communal engagement and erosion of social capital. These tensions highlight the marginalisation of Indigenous cultures and the reinforcement of colonial tendencies in digital spaces. Additionally, the study uncovers the ingenuity of Indigenous users who are integrating Indigenous knowledge and Harambee norms with digital technologies, to balance cultural sensitivity, strengthen technological inclusivity and preserve their communal values within decolonial digital fundraising. This study advances decolonial scholarship by demonstrating how the integration of both Indigenous and local practices with digital technology not only advances digital decoloniality but also enriches the technology's cultural responsiveness.

Based on a qualitative inquiry involving knowledge workers from the Global South, we develop the concepts of role emancipation , role confinement , and role conflation and examine how these types of role transitioning relate to the capabilities of digital technologies. We find that digital technologies can introduce levels of rigidity or flexibility that, in turn, either solidify or soften the domain boundaries influencing work‐life role transitions in the context of digital transformation. We abstract these ideas into a theoretical model and chart a course for consolidating a ‘micro‐level of analysis frontier’ within digital transformation research.},

Struggles with capturing employee performance are reported across different off‐site, non‐traditional forms of work, such as remote and hybrid. This article performs a comprehensive fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis to juxtaposing different configurations of job characteristics across forms of work. Our multi‐source study is based on a matched sample of 1215 diverse working personnel (with supervisors, who evaluated employee performance) in Montenegro. Based on the pathways leading to task performance in different forms of work, we develop propositions centered on the key principles of designing traditional and alternative, non‐traditional forms of work. While we confirm the importance of enriched work design, several specific characteristics and their accompanying configurations (including compensatory effects) are highlighted with regard to the task performance achieved. These include high levels of task identity for all three forms of work (on‐site, hybrid and remote). Work performed in a traditional on‐site setting additionally requires greater task variety. Conversely, remote work requires high information processing and social support. The hybrid model calls for the most complicated work design that combines essential elements of both the on‐site and remote work paradigms, namely task variety and information processing, and also for enhanced mechanisms for job feedback. Hybrid work is a universal social phenomenon still on the uptake that likely represents the future of work, and since it combines traditional settings with information and communication technologies, we also emphasise the importance of field‐bridging future research of information systems and organisational design areas.},

Much of the research literature advocates a strong information system (IS) organization‐business relationship if the IS organization and, in particular, technology is to make a value‐added contribution to the business. Although research also highlights that in many organizations this relationship is poor, little guidance is provided as to how this ‘gap’ might be bridged. The research reported in this paper is a longitudinal study of three organizations that are actively seeking to bridge the gap, improve the relationship and consequently the value that they derive from their IS investments. A process model containing six stages, illustrating the route to creating high performance from IS, is constructed from cross‐case analysis of the collected data.

We describe the challenges J&J faced during the deployment of the platform and the activities they undertook in response to these challenges. Based on that, we identify three organisational practices critical for the successful deployment of AI: blueprinting the future workforce, managing ethical data work across borders, and compensating for AI blind spots.

We collected qualitative data from 26 mumpreneurs in the United Kingdom who have caring responsibilities for young children and are running a business on the community‐based platform Instagram. We found that through using Instagram and its algorithms, mumpreneurs can create various types of value in this context. Drawing on previous research into value creation, we make several contributions to the information systems literature. First, we unpack and explain alternative forms of value generated by digital platforms. Our findings show that through community‐based platforms such as Instagram, mumpreneurs can create various types of economic and non‐economic value— engagement , cognitive , economic , and self‐preservation value —that is consistent with their business, social, and personal needs. Second, we propose a process model of value creation; and we identify two mechanisms that lead to value creation through Instagram's algorithms: recommended connectivity and adaptability . Third, we identify a temporal dimension of value creation through Instagram. This article contributes to the theory in the growing body of literature on value creation linked to digital platforms and explains several implications for theory and practice.},

   abstract                      = {ABSTRACT Rural information systems initiatives (RISIs) are ICT‐based projects intended to drive institutional change and reduce inequalities in rural communities. However, the extant information systems literature shows that many such initiatives paradoxically aggravate inequalities in other domains, but the literature provides little theoretical explanation of the mechanisms involved. This study addresses this gap from an affordance‐based institutional logics perspective. Specifically, it conceptualizes a RISI as an institution that embodies a dominant institutional logic, which shapes how technology affordances are perceived and enacted. This lens is applied to an interpretive case study of an e‐governance initiative implemented in village municipalities (i.e., village councils) in Nepal aimed at reducing knowledge inequalities in the municipalities. The initiative introduced a self‐assessment logic for evaluating local development work, which amplified existing knowledge and power inequalities over time. The case study surfaced two mechanisms through which RISIs may aggravate inequalities: (1) by impeding logic hybridization and (2) by activating discriminatory logics. These findings contribute to the theoretical understanding of RISIs and provide critical insights into the design and governance of ICT‐based initiatives in rural contexts.},

This paper advances knowledge of DD by developing and testing a configurational theory. Using a multi‐method research design, we identify two types of DD and four industry factors (downstream DD, digitally enabled structural conflict, transferability of core competitive elements, and industry player size) that contingently lead to the different types of DD. We integrate those findings into a configurational theory that describes causal recipes of how these factors or conditions combine to produce the outcome of transformational DD and destructive DD. The theory offers important implications for researchers and practitioners. The research also contributes methodologically by demonstrating the merits of combining grounded theory with qualitative comparative analysis (QCA) to expand the theory‐building potential of QCA.},

Governments worldwide are starting to recognise the potential of digital nomadism to improve local visitor economies. However, the impacts of digital nomadism on local communities, their culture and economies, are not without challenges and require further understanding. Almost all existing studies on digital nomadism focus on the nomads themselves, while, in this study, we take the perspective of the locals visited by digital nomads. Using the case study of Chiang Mai, the “digital nomad capital”, we answer the following research questions: What are the impacts of digital nomadism on local communities? How do digital nomads compare to other visitor types within the visitor economy of a local community? Our findings reveal diverse socio‐cultural, economic and technological impacts and how locals in Chiang Mai evaluate digital nomads differently compared to other types of visitors. This research, grounded in an in‐depth case study, contributes to a better understanding of digital nomadism by offering new knowledge about its ambivalent impacts on local communities.

This article builds on successful, long‐term Danish experiences with digital government reform and offers “nuggets of wisdom” to policymakers, organisations, and countries wishing to advance such reform. In international surveys, Denmark is consistently ranked as a global frontrunner in digital government. This article builds on a longitudinal case study of digital development paths in two digitally mature Danish policy domains: Civil registry administration and illness benefit reimbursement administration. Across the cases, we find that the development is characterised by multiple actors, as well as complex, non‐linear and partly unpredictable paths. In both cases, technology arrangements are characterised by a long lifespan, producing a pattern of “cumulative complexity” where business processes, data, and technology become increasingly intertwined. This severely complicates effective strategic planning by policymakers. Taking these “real‐life” experiences into consideration, we formulate six policy‐making implications elaborated in several practitioner guidelines that represent best‐practice recommendations for policymakers wishing to nurture possible roads to digitally mature government.},

Contributing to this area of research, this paper offers a conceptual definition of the cognitive validity concept, defined as the extent to which a scale is free of problematic item characteristics (PICs) that bias the survey response process and subsequent empirical results. Building on this conceptualization effort, a new methodological process for assessing the cognitive validity of adapted IS measures is introduced. Through a series of three programmatic studies, we find converging evidence that the method can benefit the IS field by making the scale adaptation process more robust, transparent, and consistent. Along with the method, we introduce a new index that IS scholars can use to benchmark the cognitive quality of their scales against venerable IS measures. We discuss the implications of our work for IS research (including detailed implementation guidelines) and provide directions for future research on measurement in IS.},

Online‐to‐offline platform businesses must synchronise online platform growth with offline product transaction growth because online platforms may attract users, but value generation and capture occur through offline product transactions. If one outpaces the other, either demand cannot be satisfied, or costs increase disproportionally. How do online‐to‐offline platform businesses navigate this dilemma? We report on the exemplary case of Vytal, an innovative startup that has managed to become the world‐largest provider of smart reusable packaging solutions in the food retail sector. Vytal couples the distribution of offline food containers with an online transaction platform application that connects restaurants, canteens, and supermarkets with consumers. We trace how Vytal strategically organised and orchestrated their growth online and offline. Based on our analysis, we offer a framework containing practical lessons for how companies can grow online‐to‐offline platform business models and navigate the trade‐offs between the online and offline components of such business models.},

We explore affective polarisation on social media and its implications for online intergroup interaction. Using social identity theory, we investigate the effects of group identification, passion, and affective polarisation on social media users' intergroup approach and avoidance tendencies. We test the research model in the context of political groups on social media. We find group identification contributes to affective polarisation by strengthening favouritism for the ingroup rather than hostility for the outgroup. Although those with greater group identification prefer to confront (approach) the opposition group on social media, the behaviour is a function of inflated feelings for the ingroup more so than animus for the outgroup.

Our findings imply affective polarisation contributes to group isolation that may exacerbate ideological polarisation.},

However, patient gratitude in OMCs, another crucial outcome for physicians' knowledge sharing, has largely been overlooked. To address this gap, this study attempts to distinguish patient satisfaction from gratitude in OMCs and elucidate the relationship between the sharing process and outcomes. Drawing on the affect theory of social exchange, this study proposes a model that investigates the relative effects of physicians' informational and emotional support during the knowledge‐sharing process on patient satisfaction and gratitude, as well as the contingent roles of physicians' professional seniority and patients' disease severity. The research model is tested by using data from a well‐known online health platform in China. The results indicate that patient gratitude is associated with a more favourable service evaluation than satisfaction in OMCs. Physicians' informational support has a greater effect on patient satisfaction than emotional support, while emotional support has a greater effect on patient gratitude than informational support. Moreover, professional seniority and disease severity positively and negatively moderate the relationship between emotional support and patient gratitude, respectively. A survey‐based experiment is also adopted to validate the research model with self‐reported perceptual measures. This study contributes to the literature on patient gratitude, online healthcare service evaluation, knowledge sharing, and the affect theory of social exchange.},

By analysing the data through the grounded theory method, our study identifies the indigenous theoretical concept of tương thân tương ái . We further unveil a process model consisting of six mechanisms through which tương thân tương ái inspires crisis response on social media and three roles assumed by social media during this process. Our study contributes to the literature on social media‐enabled crisis response by providing an indigenous perspective and a context‐specific explanation. It also enriches IS theory in the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN) by investigating how the indigenous concept of tương thân tương ái influences Vietnam's crisis response on social media.

Power imbalances are at play when donors from the Global North finance and thereby set the development agenda for the Global South without concern for the actual needs. IT use in development aid is an important tool in decolonisation struggles, but corresponding structures also risk cementing problematic power distributions. As such, guidelines are needed on how to set up and decolonize IT governance structures. Using insights from a case study of a large international development aid NGO and building on the African emancipation philosophy Ubuntu, we propose five organising principles for a decolonized IT governance.

In the context of electronic health record (EHR) systems, this study examines when misfits experienced between an EHR system and health professionals' work practices lead to workarounds with negative consequences in terms of aggravating misfits. Our qualitative study was conducted in two tertiary hospitals in The Netherlands that had implemented an off‐the‐shelf EHR system. We analysed the “misfit experience → response → consequence” sequences that emerged from interviews complemented with observations and documents. Experienced misfits between the EHR and other work system components induced highly varied responses, among which workarounds. While workarounds can be beneficial, we found occasions where workarounds resulted in aggravated misfits. We conceptualise three underlying misfit‐aggravating EHR‐use patterns emerging from (1) a non‐routine practice's perceived exceptionality, (2) collective separatism in incompatible routine practices, and (3) individual deviancy in routine work practices. These patterns differ in terms of the work practices' routineness, professionals' misfit experiences, and in how this combination provokes an individual or collective workaround that is non‐compliant with both the designed technology use and the organisational intent. To understand how these patterns emerge, we discuss the interplay among work practice routineness, misfit characteristics, and non‐compliant workaround behaviours.},

Using design ethnography, we follow the development of a solidarity cryptocurrency in a Brazilian favela. Our paper offers two key contributions. By introducing tecnologia social , an underrepresented perspective in IS, we highlight ecology of knowledges, centrality of the local and decolonial reconfiguration as principles that can enrich the understanding of IS projects from a decolonial perspective. In addition, we propose a new concept—epistemic dialogical tension—as a process wherein different epistemologies coexist and accommodate each other, encouraging a dynamic interplay of distinct human experiences and worldviews. It offers new paths to IS scholars and practitioners in navigating the complexities of epistemic plurality. We argue that tecnologia social and epistemic dialogical tension provide fertile ground for developing reimagined, decolonized approaches where multiple epistemologies can coexist, favouring the often‐silenced communities they are intended to benefit.},

In response, this paper presents a problematization review that critiques and revises three widely held assumptions about digital innovations: (1) that they generate net benefits that outweigh the associated harm; (2) that their ethicality can be calculated through utility and (3) that their harms can be mitigated through technological, corporate or regulatory intervention. We argue that compassion provides a pluralistic ethical foundation that integrates the strengths of consequentialism, deontology, and virtue ethics. This framework prioritises serving all stakeholders, especially the most vulnerable, while avoiding harm. It sets a research agenda focused on addressing structural dysfunctions, amplifying marginalised voices, and fostering sustainable systems.

We demonstrate how the management of the tension entails an interactive process in which a platform leader decouples counterfeit fighting actions to pursue legitimacy. We suggest that pressures from external forces predict a process of decoupling and legitimation through which the platform leader promotes ecosystem acceptance and builds a shared understanding of ecosystem purposes, and the endeavours to balance platform quality and activity prompt the platform leader to pursue legitimation which demonstrates the viability of an ecosystem. We show that these processes are accompanied by activating and stabilising the tension, which predicts varied strength and scope of measures and the reduction of counterfeits over time.},

Recent advancements in AI, particularly machine learning and natural language processing, offer promising tools for enhancing product innovation. However, small businesses often face significant challenges in adopting AI due to limited financial resources, data infrastructure, technical expertise, operational and cultural barriers. This paper presents a novel and holistic human–AI‐assisted product innovation (HAIAPI) framework designed to address these challenges by integrating an advanced large language model approach across four key stages of the product innovation process: (1) AI‐augmented problem articulation, (2) human expert problem selection, (3) AI‐augmented solution generation and (4) human expert solution selection. Through an in‐depth case study of an Australian e‐retailer, this paper provides practical insights into how AI can enhance problem articulation and solution generation, while human expertise ensures relevant problem and solution selection. The detailed instructions on implementing this framework, including Generative Pre‐Trained Transformers prompts, for small businesses are supported by a comprehensive resource toolkit and checklist detailing necessary financial, technical and human resources. Last, three key principles of human–AI collaboration are synthesised, offering further actionable strategies for small business managers/owners looking to effectively integrate AI into their product innovation processes.},

   abstract                      = {Knowledge is an invaluable resource and a key to organisational success. To leverage this resource adequately, organisations must encourage their employees to share what they know with their peers. Enterprise social media (ESM) has emerged as an ideal venue for achieving this goal, and numerous studies have examined the drivers of work‐related knowledge contributions on these platforms. The present study contributes to this body of research by examining a prevalent yet underexplored form of knowledge sharing that often occurs on ESM: nonwork‐related knowledge contributions. We argue that contrary to a commonly held belief, this presumably hedonic employee behaviour can benefit organisations through its spillover effect on the work domain. In other words, we argue that nonwork‐related knowledge contributions on ESM can foster work‐related ones. Building on social exchange theory and on the associative–propositional evaluation model in social psychology, we also show that the employee–employer (EE) relationship—conceptualised in terms of perceived organisational support and perceived employee psychological safety—moderates the relationship between the two forms of knowledge contributions. The analysis of field data collected from 269 employees of a French e‐commerce company confirmed that nonwork‐related knowledge contributions are positively associated with work‐related ones and that this positive association is moderated by the EE relationship. We discuss the theoretical contributions of our results and explain key managerial implications for organisations hoping to reap the benefits of ESM in a sustainable way.},

We tested our model using a three‐wave time‐lagged survey study with data collected from 268 employees. Challenge and hindrance technostressors had different effects on these two main forms of work–family conflict (time‐based and strain‐based) but further induced negative effects on both job and family satisfaction.

Considering this, we analyse how institutional factors can affect digital entrepreneurship by SMEs and startups and what types of institutional changes are needed to support digital entrepreneurship by these companies. Based on institutional theory as a theoretical lens, we conducted two case studies in Brazil. The research results indicate that the digital entrepreneurial ecosystem's actors perform institutional work that generates changes related to the regulative, normative, and cultural/cognitive institutional pillars. These changes affect both the legitimacy of digital innovations created by SMEs and startups and the legitimacy of these companies as ecosystem players, which is vital for them to access the resources needed to innovate and thrive. Based on these results, we propose a theoretical framework and provide suggestions for practice and public policies related to digital entrepreneurship by SMEs and startups in the context studied.},

   abstract                      = {Gatekeepers, including prerogative elites and institutions, possess multifaceted tools for controlling information. Historically, these gatekeepers have systematically instrumentalized visual information to shape audience perceptions in alignment with specific agendas. However, the advent of social media platforms has disrupted these power dynamics, empowering audiences through user‐driven visual information exchanges. This has led to visual audience gatekeeping whereby users act as audience gatekeepers by selectively disseminating visual content, thus shaping information diffusion. While this democratisation of gatekeeping holds considerable promise for user empowerment, it also presents risks. These risks stem from the inherently persuasive yet manipulative qualities of visual content, compounded by users' susceptibility to unconscious biases, especially during polarising events. Therefore, we critically investigated visual audience gatekeeping in the context of the Russo–Ukrainian War, specifically focusing on a Reddit subforum devoted to Russia‐related discussions. We find that visual audience gatekeeping operates within a paradigm that reflects the social reality the audience embraces. Audience gatekeepers disseminate visual information both to reproduce and defend an idealised conception of this social reality. Collectively, they produce a visual echo chamber characterised by low information diversity, which, in turn, reinforces and perpetuates the incumbent paradigm. However, heightened social tensions can trigger a paradigm shift and amplify the reproduction and defence processes, increasing the potential for the diffusion of more radical and extreme visual narratives. Based on our findings, we propose a theoretical model of visual audience gatekeeping, which has important implications for research on visuals, gatekeeping and social media platforms.},

This paper fills the gap by investigating how organisations enact the affordances of IS in preserving intangible cultural heritage (ICH) to contribute to a sustainable visitor economy. Using an organisational aesthetics perspective, we explore the mechanisms through an in‐depth case study of an ICH‐based company in Jingdezhen, a famous historical porcelain city in China. Through the effective use of IS tools, the case organisation has successfully transformed from a ceramic manufacturing plant to a popular tourist attraction. Our study unveils six sustainable affordances of IS in three dimensions, wherein ICH aesthetics act as direct stimuli, knowledge tools and experiences. Affordances emerge from the processes of both creating and managing aesthetics. By enacting these affordances, the case organisation builds a more profound engagement with online audiences, attracts more ICH visitors and transfers ICH knowledge to potential inheritors of the tradition, creating a sustainable visitor economy. Our findings, summarised into a sustainable affordances model, contribute to the IS for sustainable tourism literature by shedding light on the black box of the social mechanisms of IS‐enabled ICH preservation. The sustainable affordances model can also help ICH‐based organisations reflect on how to build a sustainable visitor economy using IS.},

We propose that firm characteristics (i.e., managerial experience and firm size) affect the firm‐level relationship between bribery and digitization. We also examine how the perceived tax burden mediates the effect of bribery on digitization. Our study is both theoretically and practically relevant. Theoretically, we are among the first to explicate the direct relationship between bribery and digitization. This novel perspective extends the information systems literature to explain digitization challenges in Latin America. For managers and policymakers, we present a path towards essential digitization for Latin American SMEs. Our empirical analysis uses secondary data from a World Bank survey of 1549 Latin American SMEs conducted over three years in six countries. Our findings show that bribery negatively influences digitization while SME characteristics positively moderate this relationship. In addition, we show that the perceived tax burden mediates the effects of bribery on digitization.},

However, it is challenging to steer a DT endeavour, which is also difficult to assess because of its complex nature. Instead of focusing solely on the typical end result of DT, we propose using a DT landscape approach. This approach considers the dynamic equilibrium of five dimensions—DT objectives, technology implementation, DT key matrices, DT complexity, and DT overall maturity—in a synergistic and iterative way, allowing organisations to effectively navigate the DT journey. Considering changes in one dimension create ripple effects on the others, steering a long journey of transformation requires iterative use of the DT landscape. Via a showcase, we demonstrate that overseeing the landscape and assessing the organisation's position in the DT trajectory helps management determine whether the organisation is ready to take the next steps. These five dimensions in conjunction assist top leadership steering the DT journey in their organisations. Key findings, implications, and conclusions are provided according to this perspective of DT landscape.},

   abstract                      = {ABSTRACT To remain competitive, many organisations are undertaking agile transformations in pursuit of agility. Information technology (IT) plays a pivotal role in supporting organisational agility; thus, it is essential that organisations select the right IT projects in a timely manner to deliver. In practice, though, organisations have struggled with effective decision‐making in the IT planning process, especially in competitive environments where there is a need for agile decisions. To guide organisations on how they can transform their IT project selection (ITPS) process to become more agile, we examine two large and well‐established Australian organisations and their digital‐only subsidiaries launched as agile organisations in start‐up style. We explain how the parent companies conduct ITPS and contrast this with the digital‐only subsidiaries, highlighting the strengths and challenges each approach presents for agility. We provide an ITPS agility framework that identifies five dimensions that can enable or inhibit agility. These are: ITPS funding approach , number of ITPS decision‐makers , granularity of ITPS work‐packages , frequency of ITPS process and duration of ITPS process . Our findings indicate that the traditional approach that the parent organisations have taken with these ITPS dimensions has inhibited agility, whereas the ITPS dimensions have been configured to enable agility in their digital‐only subsidiaries. We recommend that those responsible for agile transformations of ITPS within their organisations fund teams instead of projects, delegate ITPS decision‐making authority, make faster and more frequent ITPS decisions about work‐packages that are smaller in scope, and use agility in the right places, as ITPS does not always need to be agile.},

However, such forms of online learning often suffer from low sustained learning engagement. Building on theories related to normative influences, this study extends the literature by focusing on the effect of peer information on learning engagement and outcomes in an online learning setting without external incentives. A field experiment was conducted through a leading massive open online course platform in China, and information interventions were manipulated in social media groups associated with the course. Surprisingly, the results revealed that the presence of peers' active learning behaviour information did not always lead to enhanced learning engagement. Specifically, it had a positive influence only when question intervention was applied, that is, when the learners were also presented with questions related to the course content prior to learning. Moreover, question intervention alone was effective in enhancing learning engagement. Our results also showed that the learners with question interventions were more likely to pay attention to their peers' behaviour and align their learning pace with that of their peers.

The plethora of perspectives on responsible AI often leaves practitioners overwhelmed and confused about how to start and how to ensure efforts are embedded in ongoing practice, not just one‐off activities. Further, leaders who are concerned about the role of human‐centred values, like dignity, are often disappointed about a lack of guidance to practically make this prioritisation a reality in technology development. This paper presents a framework—the Dignity Lens—for reflecting on how technologies developed and/or implemented impact (human) relationships. The Dignity Lens is the outcome of multi‐year design science research undertaken in three organisational contexts. In this article, we describe the journey of the Dignity Lens from inception to now and an in‐depth application of the Dignity Lens in the most recent organisational context within which it was developed. We illustrate how this organisation has begun to embed the Dignity Lens into their everyday practices and the benefits of doing so. We argue that the Dignity Lens offers a unique way for practitioners to exercise protective and proactive responsibility and tangibly engage with concepts of dignity while building algorithms, offering space for constructive reflection, innovation and accountability in line with human‐centred commitments.},

A new wave of start‐ups shows that ecological sustainability can be integral to a business model (BM) without compromising economic success. Like start‐ups that designed their BMs to be ecologically and economically sustainable, incumbents also need to undergo two fundamental transformations in parallel: digital and sustainable BM transformation. While each transformation alone is considered demanding, we examined 31 start‐ups to develop a taxonomy of digital sustainable BMs to understand how companies can master these complementary challenges and provide guidelines on achieving ecological and economic sustainability by implementing digital BMs. We use this taxonomy to derive four distinct archetypes of how sustainability can be an integral part of the BM: Sustainable Software Solutions , Sustainable Product‐Service Systems , Sustainability Intelligence , and Digital Sustainable Platforms . For each archetype, we reveal the role of digital technology in creating ecological BMs and how these BMs create sustainable value from an ecological, economic, and technological perspective. Therefore, we go beyond using digital technology to optimise production or logistics or enable remote work and implement sustainability as an integral part of the core logic of the organisation and its identity. For practice, our strategy guidelines contribute to creating a sustainable reality based on digital technology implemented in the BMs.},

In this article, we theorise that EXM platforms are implanted into the workflow through digital embeddedness, which is appropriated and reconfigured through the interactions between human and digital subsystems in hybrid work. We adopt the lens of digital/human interaction to explore the reciprocal process of how EXM platforms configure and are reconfigured in hybrid work. Based on a case study of Microsoft Viva, an AI‐based EXM platform, we propose a conceptual model that identifies two dimensions of digital embeddedness: digital/human embeddedness and digital/workplace embeddedness. The study contributes to a theoretical understanding of digital embeddedness as a dynamic process whilst also showing the reconfiguration of hybrid work practices evidences a joint optimization. The study further contributes insights into how hybrid work, which resulted from the enforced remote work during the COVID‐19 pandemic, continues to emerge due to the digital embeddedness of EXM platforms in the flow of hybrid work.},

The current Information Systems (IS) literature, however, struggles to describe control on digital platforms in a way that does justice to the dynamic character of the phenomenon. Taking this as an opportunity, we follow the enactment of control over time and across parties in a hybrid ethnographic study of the social commerce platform Poshmark. Specifically, we conceptualise the dynamics of control as changes in the means of control—formal or informal—and the sources of control—operator or participants—over time. Tracking these conceptual dimensions, we identify the distinct ways control has changed on Poshmark. Synthesising these findings into four dynamics of control, we show that control on digital platforms is rarely static due to aggregate effects arising from the operator and from participant interactions with each other through the digital features deployed on the platform. Based on these insights, our study contributes to the IS literature on control by broadening the conception of control on digital platforms. The theoretical and practical insights generated in this paper thereby lay the foundation for the systematic study of the dynamics of control that are unique to platform environments.},

To understand the drivers of successful and unsuccessful telework, we used a mixed methods approach, taking a stress‐theoretic and configurational perspective. In Study 1, we conducted a quantitative analysis of data collected in a survey of 375 teleworkers to identify configurations of information and communication technology (ICT), work and family related challenge and hindrance stressors that lead to high and low telework success. In Study 2, we analysed qualitative data collected in interviews with 52 teleworkers to shed light on the interplay among ICT, work and family related challenge and hindrance stressors in the configurations that lead to high and low telework success. We contribute to telework research by showing that high and low telework success results from configurations of ICT, work and family related challenge and hindrance stressors. We extend the literature by showing that teleworkers benefit from challenge stressors only when they do not experience hindrance stressors. Methodologically, we provide a blueprint for an innovative approach using deductive fsQCA to refine, extend and delimit theory.},

Tourism enterprises face the key decision of whether to join third‐party platforms or sell tourism services/products directly to consumers. Some researchers have addressed issues about online tourism platforms, but none analyse the internal mechanism and operational management, or the impact of the online tourism platform on sustainable economic growth and social welfare. To fill this gap, we establish an analytical model to explore the optimal tourism marketing and operational management of online tourism platforms for non‐profit tourist attractions and for‐profit tourism enterprises, which can help guide the decisions of managers. We construct a game‐theoretical model in which competing tourism attractions can choose only solo or dual online tourism platform promotion. When competition on a third‐party platform is intense, for‐profit tourism enterprises benefit from dual platforms. We further illustrate that with high competition, non‐profit tourist attractions provide higher social welfare when offering tourism products/services on both self‐established and third‐party tourism channels. However, with lower competition, third‐party tourism platforms harm social welfare if the tourism service/product quality is extremely high or low. Under a decentralised structure, we find that related tourism enterprises prefer to follow and collaborate with their tourist attractions' channel selection when competition in the third‐party platform is not fierce. This result indicates that a third‐party tourism platform improves the visitor economy and social welfare if the tourist attraction collaborates with its tourism‐related enterprises through the online tourism platform.},

   abstract                      = {ABSTRACT Artificial intelligence (AI) brings great potential for manufacturers, but clashes with the established culture due to the unexplainable and opaque nature of the solutions it provides. Having little experience in AI and machine learning (ML), most manufacturing leaders experience barriers implementing AI. This is especially true in lean environments, since these are often nearly perfected and hence intolerant of failure. Cultural barriers to adoption abound, even if the quality of the AI is assured. Deeply grounded in the case of Siemens' Digital Industries division, this 5‐year practitioner research investigates AI adoption in lean quality management. Collaborating with key executives involved in the case and fellow researchers, we investigate the challenges and solutions of AI adoption in lean quality management. We identify three distinct paradoxes: (1) Human‐driven versus AI‐driven analysis, decisions and actions, (2) transparency versus opacity and (3) specification‐driven versus discovery‐driven processes to achieve quality. Rooted in Siemens' experience, we derive four strategies for overcoming these paradoxes. Our findings have important implications for practice, as we present clear and realistic steps and guidance for effective AI integration into lean quality management environments. Our results contribute to the discourse on AI adoption, pointing to the importance of recognising potential cultural clashes as well as strategies for overcoming these which go beyond the technology itself.},

   abstract                      = {ABSTRACT As digital technologies continue to shape various industries, firms face the challenge of incentivising user participation in innovation through technology use in digital platforms. This study adopts a problematisation approach to challenge dominant assumptions in digital innovation and information systems (IS) literature. Based on this, we integrate the Awareness‐Motivation‐Capability (AMC) theory and Regulatory Focus Theory (RFT), investigating how ambidextrous use of digital technology (AUDT) impacts digital product innovation through unleashing user potential creativity. Drawing on a dataset of 79 682 users from Thingiverse, our empirical findings reveal that AUDT significantly enhances innovation performance. Yet, a tension within user potential creativity emerges: while AUDT strengthens lead userness and thereby improves innovation outcomes, it concurrently diminishes intrinsic motivation, which negatively impacts performance. Furthermore, user regulatory focus moderates these effects: promotion focus exerts two‐sided effects—positively/negatively moderating the relationships between AUDT, intrinsic motivation/lead userness, and innovation performance. Prevention focus consistently attenuates these effects. This study offers several contributions to IS and digital innovation literature. First, we extend the conceptualisation of AUDT as a mechanism for balancing efficiency and exploration in digital platforms. Second, we uncover the tension between lead userness and intrinsic motivation within user potential creativity. Third, by examining the mediating/moderating role of user potential creativity/regulatory focus, we advance a more nuanced understanding of how digital technology use, individual traits and psychological orientations interact. These insights offer valuable theoretical and practical implications for IS and digital innovation management.},

Successful DT journeys require adopting new technologies alongside a comprehensive set of organisational capabilities and skills, heightening the challenge for small and medium enterprises (SMEs). Shifting from its original emphasis on efficiency and cost savings, information technology outsourcing (ITO) is evolving into a tool for SMEs to aid their technology assimilation process; however, engaging IT services while pursuing innovation has often been perceived as a paradox that necessitates careful management. This practitioner paper examines the case study of product and platform‐based DT at Fuertafit, a prominent digital health and fitness SME with a social media reach of approximately 9 million people. The company helps individuals adopt sustainable, healthy behaviours related to physical activity, nutrition, and mental well‐being. Our research aims to understand how SMEs can leverage ITO to support the launch of new products and digital platforms while smoothly transitioning to an in‐house operating model. The case study highlights the benefits of initially leveraging ITO in areas with limited IT skills and resources, identifies several challenges to consider, and provides practical guidelines in the form of five principles for successful product and platform DT in the SME context: (1) make a holistic strategic DT decision including ‘what’ and ‘how’; (2) set up a cross‐functional agile team from the outset; (3) allocate sufficient time and resources to select ITO partners carefully; (4) establish a transparent working methodology and governance; and (5) execute a phased approach to transitioning to internal capabilities.},

Now, more than ever, there is a dire need for innovative solutions. Digital service innovation holds immense promise, offering the potential to improve health outcomes, reduce costs, enhance service quality and elevate patient experiences. However, the adoption of these innovations has been slow. The COVID‐19 pandemic served as a catalyst, dramatically accelerating the implementation of digital innovations in healthcare organisations. This rapid transformation was a necessary response to unprecedented conditions. However, there are concerns that the momentum gained during the pandemic is waning, with innovation rates slipping back to pre‐pandemic levels. This paper argues that we must harness the lessons learned from the pandemic to sustain and increase the pace of innovation, addressing healthcare organisations' urgent challenges. It aims to provide practical insights for healthcare managers at various organisational levels, drawing from a compelling case study of digital service innovation during the COVID‐19 pandemic at a Norwegian hospital. Here, practitioners will find six actionable recommendations designed to inspire and empower them to drive innovation in a post‐pandemic era. By embracing these insights, healthcare managers can lead their organisations toward a more resilient, efficient and patient‐centric future.

These logics illustrate how platform owners can verticalize the AI development process by orchestrating actors who co‐create, share and refine data and AI models, ultimately producing industry‐specific applications capable of generalisation.

   abstract                      = {ABSTRACT Workarounds in high‐hazard environments like intensive care units (ICUs) compromise safety and regulatory compliance. While prior research attributes these deviations to technology misfits and notes self‐reinforcing dynamics, the underlying mechanisms of aggravating workaround spirals remain understudied. Drawing on ethnographic observation and interviews investigating Critical Care Information System (CCIS) use, we advance a mental resource perspective positioning clinicians' cognitive load as a key driver of aggravating workarounds. Grounded in Conservation of Resources (COR) Theory and organisational control literature, we demonstrate that clinicians use workarounds (i.e., deviating CCIS use) to cope with mental overload. However, workarounds bypass not only workflow obstacles, but also organisational controls intended to support individual and collective attention. As these ‘constructive IS attention controls’ collapse, clinicians' mental load intensifies and cooperative workflows deteriorate, spawning additional workarounds in a recursive cycle linking individual coping to collective resource depletion. Our study contributes theoretically by (1) identifying mental resource depletion as one mechanism aggravating workarounds, (2) specifying this mechanism through compromised attention management, and (3) developing a process model that integrates behavioural psychology with control theory to capture how individual resource deficits and coping scale to organisational level risks. For practice, we demonstrate that addressing isolated technology misfits is insufficient to mitigate workarounds in high‐acuity settings. Instead, systemic interventions are required, such as rebalancing workload, reinforcing resilient attention controls and designing CCIS that support (re‐)focusing individual and collective attention. These insights orient scholarship and management toward cognitively sustainable healthcare technologies.},

Even those with a wealth of experience and skills may struggle to respond adequately to inherently novel situations. While skills and experience are necessary for leading DT, continuously acquiring technology and business knowledge is equally important for navigating unfamiliar situations that DT often presents. As such, knowledge represents the missing link that warrants equal attention in driving successful DT. We examined the different knowledge types that digital leaders require to effectively navigate DT. Drawing on the IT innovation and DT literatures, we developed the DT knowledge framework with six knowledge types. We analysed these knowledge types in 138 interview excerpts of chief technology officers (CTOs), chief information officers (CIOs) and chief digital officers (CDOs) leading DT taken from 128 industry articles. We find that technology know‐what —that is, knowing what technologies are available and their capabilities —and business know‐how —that is, knowing how to execute organisational change needed for DT, are the two most important knowledge types. We further unpacked the dimensions of each of these knowledge types and offered recommendations for practitioners through our novel knowledge perspective on DT leadership. We also discuss the implications of our knowledge perspective for advancing DT scholarship.},

Through the lens of Archer's (2007) three‐stage model of reflexivity and different modes of reflexivity (communicative, autonomous, meta, and fractured), we investigate the experiences of psychological empowerment and project dynamics among IS professionals in IS development work by zooming in on 6 years of three IS professionals' work lives. Our findings make several contributions to theory and practice. First, we elucidate the interplay between reflexivity and psychological empowerment. Second, we show how different IS professionals' approach similar structural, technological, or social circumstances differently (such as agile work practices), depending on their reflexive inner dialogues. This includes showing how different reflexivity modes, focused on various properties of the IS context (structural, technological, and social), becomes entangled with interpersonal dynamics and IS project dynamics.},

For each strategy, we examine what complementarities are generated and provide real‐world examples. Subsequently, we delve into a discussion of the limitations and implications associated with the integration of multiple digital platforms. We conclude by proposing avenues for future research on multi‐platform integration strategies.},

Through an in‐depth single qualitative case study at one of the Big Four consulting firms, which serves as a paradigmatic case for hybrid work, we explain how the visibility enabled by enterprise social networks can alleviate or impede vicarious learning in hybrid work environments. We identify three instances of the visibility paradox—performance, information overload, and availability—that create a burden on both knowledge sources and seekers. Consequently, their individual strategic responses render knowledge work invisible, thereby preventing third‐parties from capitalising on the potential benefits of vicarious learning that an enterprise social network could afford.},

To do so, we conduct a problematization review across the fields of IS, strategy and entrepreneurship, organisation theory and management studies, to capture the multidimensionality of DT research. Unlike systematic literature reviews commonly found in DT research, a problematization review critically questions how theoretical contributions have been constructed in past research to develop novel theoretical questions. Our findings offer three contributions. First, we uncover five research trajectories, each with its own in‐house assumptions about the nature of digital technologies and how organisations, groups and individuals interact with those technologies and the data they generate. Second, we show how individual studies within the identified research trajectories position themselves against prior research, pointing at six distinct processes of constructing theoretical contributions. Finally, we mobilise new frontiers of research by questioning DT research field assumptions that cut across the five research trajectories. We conclude by discussing the theoretical implications of our problematization review for further DT research.},

We combine qualitative interviews and heart rate variability data from an exemplar sample of 15 high performing IT professionals to provide insights into their psychological and physiological strain levels respectively. Our participants exhibit four strain levels, each related to a distinctive combination of coping behaviours, which we abductively theorise as coping portfolios. We find that high performing IT professionals with both a low psychological and physiological strain level apply a broad and varied portfolio of coping behaviours in response to diverse occupational demands. We contribute to IS research on IT professionals by studying the coping behaviours of an exemplar sample of high performing IT professionals in a leading IT firm. Theoretically, we complement the established concepts of coping flexibility and coping repertoires by introducing the notion of coping portfolios.},

To address this issue, we conducted studies of five hybrid work teams across two large organisations. The paper contributes to current research on hybrid work by (i) illustrating the various temporal concepts that may be considered in the design of hybrid work environments, as well as the impact of considering or not considering them; (ii) illustrating how these temporal concepts in a physical space can be augmented in the digital space, rather than assuming the digital space should simply represent the physical; and (iii) providing a framework for the consideration of time–aware hybrid work. We hope to spark scientific interest in studying the temporal nuances of hybrid work but also the temporal aspects of design in other areas.},

However, our understanding of this literature leads to two concerns. First, depending on traditional team‐focused collective‐level efficacy concepts conveys an indifferent view of technology that ignores decades of research explaining how virtual teams' reliance on collaborative technologies differentiates them from traditional teams. Second, the information systems literature has largely ignored the concept of collective‐level efficacy in virtual team research. That collective‐level efficacy is underexamined in IS research is disappointing, given the growing recognition (outside the IS literature) that it is crucial to virtual team success. This absence becomes even more concerning given that IS researchers developed the concept of virtual team efficacy (VTE) specifically for virtual team settings. Unlike collective‐level efficacy measures designed for traditional team settings, VTE incorporates technology into its conceptual definition and the operationalization of its measurement indicators. Thus, it is a stronger predictor of virtual team outcomes. To demonstrate its importance to IS research, we used a deductive theory‐driven approach to propose and empirically evaluate whether VTE indirectly acts on virtual team effectiveness through the critical concepts of trust and participants' perceptions of problems associated with the collaboration inhibitors of time difference, geographical separation, and cultural differences. This research contributes significantly to the literature by confirming VTE's relationship to important virtual team success factors and informing IS researchers about the appropriate choice of constructs when studying collective‐level efficacy in virtual team settings.},

Unfortunately, participants are frequently demotivated by technical difficulties and the incorrect use of CS systems, which can result in CS failure. Although the literature generally assumes that sustained participation in CS is determined by a shift between intrinsic and extrinsic motivation, the role of system‐use practices in facilitating such a shift remains unknown. We explore how CS system‐use practices influence participants' sustained motivation, evolving from initiation to progression to sustention. Using the notion of technology‐in‐practice as a lens, we develop and examine a process model using an in‐depth case study of a large‐scale ongoing CS project, the Australian Newspaper Digitisation Program. The findings suggest that CS participants' motivation is shaped by an evolving combination of three basic components (i.e., contextual condition, outcome and action intensity) and mediated by two types of system‐use practice (i.e., passive and active). Passive‐use practices facilitate sustaining motivation from initiation to progression, whereas active‐use practices have a key role in sustention. Our study contributes to the emerging literature on the substantial role of system‐use practices in sustaining motivation, resulting in sustained participation. The findings also offer actionable insights into improving the viability of CS systems in retaining and motivating continuous and increased contributions from participants.},

This paper takes a step toward mastering it by focusing on positive stress that Information Systems (IS) creates for IS users, known as techno‐eustress. Factors that create techno‐eustress are known as techno‐eustress creators, which we conceptualise as cognitions experienced by IS users, that IS positively challenges and motivates them to enhance their work. They are important to study because they represent foundational opportunities for professional achievement and growth emanating from IS use. Drawing from theories of psychological eustress, self‐determination and proactive work, this paper theorises and validates an instrument to measure techno‐eustress creators. We establish the construct's validity and examine its nomological relationships based on data collected from working professionals who used IT for their work. We draw on data from two qualitative studies ( N = 35) and three quantitative surveys ( N = 980) conducted at different points in time. We validate techno‐eustress creators as a second‐order reflective construct having four dimensions: techno‐mastery, techno‐autonomy, techno‐enrichment and techno‐relatedness. We examine its nomological relationships with factors that create techno‐distress, IT strain, and user satisfaction. We contribute to the literature by theorising and validating four ways in which IS users are challenged and motivated by IS to enhance their work. We inform to managerial practice by drawing attention to how organisations can strengthen the different ways employees experience the creators of the ‘good’ stress that use of IS generates.},
